        "description": "The Lung Wei Wind Cold Syndrome is a new type of wind cold syndrome characterized by the stagnation of pathogenic factors in the lung Wei. It is a shallow syndrome of wind cold syndrome and belongs to the original disease of wind cold. It can be roughly divided into three types: external syndrome internal syndrome and external internal syndrome. The external syndrome is divided into wind cold depression and yin wei depression characterized by systemic symptoms such as aversion to wind cold fever and head and body pain; The internal syndrome is characterized by wind and cold stagnation in the lung orifices characterized by local symptoms such as chest tightness cough and asthma; The exterior and interior syndromes have both the above two types of characteristics which belong to the wind cold stagnation and the suppression of the clear yang qi while the exterior and interior diseases are the same. In clinical practice the three can be transformed into each other that is they can be transmitted to each other: external symptoms can be seen in people and internal symptoms can also be seen in appearance. However its pathogenesis always belongs to the stagnation of wind and cold in the lung so its treatment should always be based on venting the wind and cold in the lung.",

It is one of the exterior and interior combined diseases of wind cold syndrome. Typhoid fever is commonly referred to as the Yang Ming Meridian Syndrome or the Sun Yang Ming Syndrome. The external syndrome is always caused by the stagnation of wind and cold which suppresses the yang qi of the lungs and stomach and cannot stir up the yang of the Wei outside; The internal cannot declare the clear yang but becomes the evidence of the external and internal. The treatment should be mainly to stimulate the yang qi of the lungs and stomach so that the external reaches the Wei Yang and passes through the muscle barrier while the internal clears the Yang and passes through the upper and lower surfaces. This will lead to the stagnation of wind and cold which can be resolved by reaching the external in one go; If it fails to dissipate due to wind cold and stagnation it can lead to the stagnation of yang qi in the camp and become spots the depression of Buddha in the clearing of yang and become madness the inversion of the upper part in the lungs and fullness of breath and the stagnation of the lower part in diarrhea and diuresis all of which belong to the syndrome of transformation.",

        "description": "The syndrome of lung and spleen wind cold is often caused by weak yang qi in the spleen and stomach sudden sensation of wind cold and a combination of external and internal factors as well as the upper and middle jiao. Typhoid fever is known as Taiyin stroke syndrome. The lungs govern the skin and hair the spleen governs the muscles and the lungs and spleen govern the upper middle and clear yang qi. They regulate qi and body fluids so there are fewer cases of pure superficial syndrome more cases of combined external and internal diseases and more cases of entrapment deficiency. Always suppressed by wind and cold stagnation with a clear Yang qi in the upper and middle parts unable to produce striae on the outside and consolidating the limbs; Unable to transport and transform body fluids internally applying water essence or causing diarrhea due to the sinking of qi or causing edema due to the overflow of muscle striae resulting in stagnation of meridians; Paralysis. The clear yang in the upper and middle parts of the lung and spleen and the camp and defense are also the masters. Therefore its treatment should always warm and unblock the yang qi to stimulate the middle yang so that the clear yang qi can rise and then reach the exterior and interior and the wind and cold can be dispersed. The Qi mechanism can rise and fall in an orderly manner and the evil of wind and cold can be resolved from the exterior through the interior. Even if there are internal symptoms the evil can still be released from the outside. Although there are internal symptoms the evil can also be resolved by removing the internal symptoms and the so-called external and internal self harmony.",

        "description": "The lung and kidney wind cold syndrome is often caused by people with deficiency of kidney qi. External wind cold directly affects the lung and kidney and the upper and lower jiao are concurrent. Typhoid fever is commonly referred to as the sun deficiency yin dual sensation syndrome which also indicates the deficiency of the solid and internal qi. Although the kidney is affected by water and fire it is mainly due to kidney yang deficiency. Yang deficiency can easily lead to yin evil but there are also cases of kidney yin deficiency and feeling wind cold. People with deficiency of yin and yang are also more susceptible to wind and cold. Therefore it can be roughly divided into yang deficiency and yin deficiency. Yin deficiency often carries internal heat or due to the prolonged accumulation of heat due to wind and cold it leads to a febrile disease of less yin and qi. Therefore there are also mixed periods of cold and heat. If the disease is mild but does not occur or if it is delayed and untreated it can also stay in the human meridian or in the yang meridian or in the blood meridian resulting in diseases such as scalp wind bone stiffness osteoma paraplegia etc. The treatment of lung and kidney wind cold syndrome should always assist yang and dispel evil using warming and dispersing as the method. For those with yin deficiency it should also be taken as a nourishing and nourishing product. However for fear of stagnation of evil it should not be excessive and it must be accompanied by products that promote yang and dispel evil in order to prevent the harm of greasy stagnation. If there is already internal heat the taste of clearing and resolving should not be lacking but it should be considered in order of priority either warming first and then cooling or combining cold and warm depending on the situation and not paranoid.",

As Yu Genchu said \"This evil stagnation of the obstruction of the meridian is contrary to the upper energizer and the Shaoyang meridian disease tends to be a half surface syndrome.\" Its pathogenesis is disharmony between the exterior and interior unfavorable ascending and descending and inability to reach the evil energy desire. The main pulse syndrome is characterized by cold and heat chest and flank pain restlessness nausea pulse string and white fur. The treatment should be based on the principle of dredging the gallbladder and stomach regulating the exterior and interior ascending and descending and assisting the evil to reach the exterior. However since it is wind cold it should be evacuated naturally. Although the wind cold has gradually entered the interior the external evil is still present so sweat can still be released from the surface. Zhong Jing has the method of \"adding three taels of osmanthus twigs to warm the skin and slightly sweat to heal\"; But it is not advisable to forcefully sweat causing the body fluid to become disabled and turn into heat. Therefore Zhong Jingyun said \"Those who are thirsty after taking Chaihu Tang belong to Yangming and should be governed by the rule of law.\" It is necessary to wait until \"the upper jiao is clear the body fluid is able to flow down the stomach qi is harmonious and the body naturally sweats out",

Or from the mouth to the nose with the nose opening to the lungs and the mouth opening to the stomach; Or the lung and stomach may have latent heat which is triggered by exogenous wind heat; There are many internal and external diseases and there are also many internal symptoms; Wind evil stagnation on the surface and heat evil steaming in the interior are the symptoms of external stagnation and internal steaming. The mild is the same disease as the health and qi; The stomach is the hometown of qi and blood so for severe cases it can involve both yin and blood and is the same disease as wei qi yin and blood; Or the evil caused by the division of qi cannot be resolved and it can be transformed into human camp and blood; The original latent heat triggered by the evil of Qi can be caused by the external and internal diseases of Qi and blood. If the evil of Wei Fen has been eliminated it can be transformed into a pure evidence of Li; If evil has already entered the human body it is extremely easy to transform into dryness and fire and transform into a syndrome of dryness and heat and dryness and fire. Therefore the treatment principle should be as instructed by Ye Tianshi: the method of \"ventilation outside the heat\" is to quickly disperse wind and heat so that the stagnation of heat can reach the outside and the disease can be quickly resolved. If dedicated to clearing and descending it will cause wind and evil to sink in and the stagnation and heat will be inexplicably resolved leading to other changes.",

Diseases such as head wind and diseases in the ears eyes nose pharynx cheeks etc. are all mild and shallow in evil; If the evil is severe and the disease is deep it can penetrate the meridians and cause wind spasms and pain. One type is the syndrome of wind heat entering the bloodstream and Qi and blood sharing the same disease which often occurs on the skin and is characterized by wind itching rubella sores and boils and spot pills; In severe cases it can also damage the blood vessels and cause bleeding. The pathogenesis of this disease is always wind stagnation outside and heat stagnation inside. Therefore its treatment should always be to expel wind and evil from the outside clear stagnation and heat from the inside and ensure that the wind and heat from outsiders are still thoroughly resolved from the outside to prevent deep changes in blood vessels. The disease is related to qi and blood so the medicine for clearing qi and cooling blood is also indispensable. For those who carry deficiency it is more important to use ginseng to nourish qi and blood to support the right and support the penetration making it easier for the evil of internal depression to spread outwards; However the evil has already become deeply ingrained in people. If it is not properly treated or if it is too cold to suppress or if it is mistakenly nourishing the evil will not spread outside and it will inevitably lead to lingering and lingering.",

The ancients referred to it as \"mother disease and son disease\" both of which are diseases of the liver and kidney. Moreover the syndrome of multiple deficiency and excess can be caused by overwork improper wine and color errors in traditional Chinese medicine prolonged illness causing yin damage or elderly exhaustion. Mild symptoms include excessive yang and wind movement with the wind rising and causing dizziness headache tinnitus deafness head shaking tremors paralysis and other illnesses; If it is heavy the jue yang will rise and become jue while the yin will dry up and run out causing detachment; Slow movement can cause pain and numbness through the meridians of the body.

The syndrome of excessive heart yang cannot be transmitted to the kidneys and water and fire cannot be combined resulting in the syndrome of heart kidney yang hyperactivity. It is actually a disease of the liver heart and kidney which is also a syndrome of deficiency and excess. Only the kidneys are organs of water and fire and when the water in the kidneys is depleted the fire in the kidneys cannot settle in their homes and there is a change in the rising Yang; It is a syndrome of wind and yang in the heart and kidney. Those with yin deficiency and yang hyperactivity are more solid while those with kidney yang deficiency and fire not returning to the original state and those with deficiency and yang rising are also more complex. Therefore its treatment principle is to nourish yin and subdue yang benefit kidney water lower heart fire and make both water and fire coordinated. If there are those who also see the floating of deficiency fire they must be accompanied by the method of warming the kidney and yang to induce fire and return to health and then the treatment of yin and yang secrets can be achieved.",

        "description": "Liver and kidney deficiency wind syndrome is the fundamental disease of deficiency wind. The disease is caused by kidney deficiency which cannot nourish the liver leading to the onset of liver wind. It is caused by kidney deficiency and liver wind. The ancients compared it to water not containing wood resulting in the withering of wood and the generation of wind. This is because the kidney yin is not enough to nourish the liver and wood and yin deficiency leads to wind movement. However the kidney is an organ of water and fire. Insufficient kidney water can also lead to a lack of love for yin and yang. Kidney yang cannot be replaced by yin but gradually dissipates. The deficiency of kidney yang leads to yang deficiency and wind movement which was referred to by ancient people as deficiency wind and dark movement. In addition the liver is a viscera that stores blood. Liver blood deficiency is insufficient to nourish and can also cause liver dryness and wind movement which is a syndrome of blood deficiency and wind generation. Therefore there is a syndrome of liver and kidney deficiency and wind movement with Yin deficiency and wind movement being the most common and there are also many cases of blood deficiency and wind movement. In the later stage of the disease there are also cases of Yang deficiency and wind movement. Liver and kidney deficiency wind is a disease that often occurs between clearing and clearing the orifices and meridians. In mild cases it can cause headaches and dizziness in severe cases it can cause paralysis tremors wind prickly heat wind paralysis and wind epilepsy. In acute cases it can cause stroke dysentery and syncope. In mild cases it can cause symptoms such as flaccidity Bi and hair loss. The wind of liver and kidney deficiency is always caused by the first deficiency of the liver and kidney and then the internal movement of the liver wind. Therefore the treatment principle is to mainly nourish the deficiency of the liver and kidney and for yin deficiency nourishing yin and softening the liver to quench the wind; Those with blood deficiency should nourish the blood and moisten the liver to quench the wind; People with kidney yang deficiency should also warm and nourish the kidney yang to quench the wind which also implies that yang generates yin and grows. Zhang Jingyue said \"Those who are good at nourishing yin should seek yin from yang.\" This is to help yang and also to prolong yin. Yin is calm and yang is secret and internal wind cannot rise so warming yang can also quench the wind. Syndromes are also known as liver wind rising liver wind disturbance liver wind internal movement blood deficiency generating wind wind fire attacking collaterals upper prosperity and lower deficiency yin yang deficiency liver and kidney deficiency yin yang deficiency essence and blood loss.",

        "description": "The wind syndrome of liver and spleen deficiency refers to the deficiency of both liver blood and spleen qi which cannot nourish the liver and leads to the internal movement of liver wind. The ancients referred to it as the inability of the earth to rest on the wood due to its emptiness and the wind and wood instead multiplied the spleen and soil indicating that the earth was not able to rest on the wood; Also known as soil decay and wood flourishing. It is a disease that not only disturbs the upper body but also causes headaches and dizziness; External channeling of meridians leads to flaccidity numbness and paralysis; Disturbing the mind internally can cause insomnia and palpitations. At the beginning it is a deficiency of qi and blood but over time it can also damage yin and yang. Therefore it is a wind syndrome of liver and spleen deficiency. Although wind originates from the liver the movement of liver wind has differences in qi blood yin and yang. Therefore although the treatment principles should all supplement deficiency to quench wind there is a certain emphasis on supplementing qi nourishing blood nourishing yin and assisting yang; But taking liver blood and spleen qi as the foundation is to benefit qi and blood while suppressing liver wind and should also be the main method for treating liver spleen deficiency wind syndrome. Especially with tonifying the spleen and supplementing qi as the top priority not only can one maintain a healthy temper but one can also soothe the liver and numbness; Moreover supplementing qi can generate blood as the ancients said: tangible blood originates from intangible qi; Bloodblood can nourish the liver but if the liver is nourished the internal wind cannot rise and the deficiency wind will self extinguish.",

It is commonly known as external cold and internal heat and often occurs during periods of extreme cold and heat. A common cold also known as a mild breeze can be seen from external sources. For those who suffer from febrile diseases it is referred to as warm in spring. This syndrome can be seen in the early stages of all dormant qi and warm heat triggered by cold sensation hence it is commonly referred to as cold wind causing dormant heat. As the fundamental disease of cold and heat syndrome it belongs to the category of Wei Fen syndrome according to the classification of warm disease families and still belongs to the category of Sun syndrome according to the classification of light injury cold families. Lung Wei cold and heat syndrome can be divided into exterior syndrome exterior interior syndrome and interior syndrome. The external syndrome disease lies in the Wei Fen the external and internal syndrome disease lies in the upper Jiao Qingqi and the internal syndrome lies in the lungs. Its pathogenesis: In the early stage the external cold is severe which is a syndrome of cold evil stagnation and suppression and is the main syndrome; After a short period of time the internal heat becomes severe and it becomes a syndrome of external stagnation and internal steaming which is a syndrome of transformation. The lung Wei cold heat syndrome is a syndrome of external cold and internal heat. Its treatment should always be to dissipate cold pathogenic factors from the outside and clear heat from the inside. However the dispelling of cold should not be excessive as it may cause harm to the body and aid in heat. Only a light dose of Xin San can be used and it can be slightly announced. This is the Ring of Prohibiting Sweat at at Warm Home. Clearing heat should only be mild clear and transparent and should not be administered with bitter and heavy laxatives to suppress the evil mechanism so that heat does not reach the outside but instead leads to the evil person fearing the possibility of sinking inside. This is also the method of warming the house and clearing it lightly.",

The sun bright disease of typhoid fever family referred to as warm and summer heat in warm disease family is triggered by a new sense of wind cold in heat disease; Or in winter if you are greedy for warmth you can first absorb the hot air inside and then feel the severe cold that causes the onset of winter fever. It always belongs to the syndrome of external cold triggering internal heat resulting in external cold and internal heat. The lung and stomach cold heat syndrome especially those with severe external cold is still mainly characterized by the surface syndrome of cold stagnation and yang retention and still belongs to the solar syndrome referred to by the family of typhoid fever. If the heat inside is also severe it often causes the same disease on both the surface and inside. Typhoid fever also known as Yangming disease or Sun Yangming disease. Warm heat experts call it Qi Fen Wen disease. Among them those with mild cold and shallow diseases often experience depression and suppress the clearing of qi in the upper energizer; Those with a strong emphasis on cold evil can suppress the stagnation of the upper jiao and clear yang; If the internal heat is too severe it can damage the body and consume fluids and even accumulate blood while qi and blood are both affected; If the external cold is not severe and does not affect the surface but directly invades the lungs it is considered an internal syndrome. The cold and heat syndrome of the lung and stomach is always characterized by wind cold stagnation outside and warm heat accumulation inside. If the surface cold does not dissolve the internal heat cannot penetrate outside. Therefore the treatment principle should be based on promoting permeability with the medicine taking Xin Wen. It is advisable to disperse wind cold to relieve the surface depression and restore Xin Liang to clear the stagnation heat. It is important to ensure that the accumulated heat evil is penetrated through the outside with sweat so that there is no change in the upper closure and subsidence of the lower body and it can also avoid the worry of damaging the body and blood.",

It is a syndrome of deficiency cold in the lower energizer hence it is commonly referred to as the deficiency cold in the lower energizer or Chongmai deficiency cold. Due to the deficiency of kidney yang and the decline of life gate fire the inability to warm liver yang can lead to deficiency of liver and kidney yang with yin cold rising internally; Or the deficiency of liver and kidney yang qi combined with external cold such as atrial fatigue and cold during menstruation is a combination of internal and external pathogenic factors. The pathogenesis of liver and kidney deficiency cold syndrome is initially yang deficiency and yin cold stagnation with the liver and kidney yang qi losing its ability to promote circulation and in some cases yin cold goes up and reverses leading to internal stasis. The syndrome of its transformation includes yang not absorbing yin which is characterized by deficiency cold and blood loss. In drama there are severe symptoms such as lower fainting and upper exhaustion upper prosperity and lower deficiency or dragon thunder and fire rising and fire not returning to its original state. The liver and kidney deficiency cold syndrome due to the decrease in the fire of the kidney is not enough to warm the liver yang resulting in the deficiency cold of the lower element. Therefore the principle of treatment is to mainly warm and replenish the kidney yang which is what Wang Taipu said: \"The source of beneficial fire is to eliminate the yin.\" However the kidney is originally composed of water and viscera and is related to true yin. The liver stores yin and blood and the body uses yang. Therefore the taste of warming and replenishing should not be too dry and intense as it can damage yin and consume blood. When helping the kidney yang it should balance the kidney water and when warming the liver yang it should balance the liver blood so as not to have the worry of excessive or declining.",

Deficiency cold arises internally and cannot be warmed up in the lungs resulting in the loss of warmth due to the clearing of gold. As the ancients said when water is cold gold is cold. The deficiency of yang qi in the lungs and kidneys leads to the syndrome of lung and kidney deficiency and cold. The lung dominates the health while the lower jiao also arises. If the yang of the lung and kidney is deficient the yang of the health is not fixed and external cold is also prone to attack people. Either the upper part of the lung is depressed or the lower jiao directly sinks and people are affected by the kidney; The combination of internal and external pathogens is particularly severe for diseases Either up against the lungs or down against the kidneys. Mild cases can lead to stagnation while severe cases can lead to stagnation of yang qi. Dramatic cases can cause kidney yang to float over leading to fainting and detachment. The cold syndrome of lung and kidney deficiency originates from yang deficiency so its treatment principle should be based on warming and tonifying the yang qi of the lung and kidney. Its origin lies in the deficiency of kidney yang so warming and tonifying kidney yang is particularly important; If the kidney yang is restored the water will not be cold and the gold will not be cold; The kidney is the same house as water and fire and the lung is responsible for clearing the fluid. If the temperature and dryness are too high it can harm the kidney water and lung fluid. Therefore in addition to warming and tonifying the lung and kidney yang deficiency it is also important to protect the kidney water and lung fluid so as not to have the worry of aiding yang and damaging yin.",

Therefore it is called the syndrome of heat induced wind and cold or cold stagnation and heat which is also an example of cold enveloping fire. It can be seen from the new feeling of the summer moon that those with severe heat are called heat warmth while those with severe dampness are called heat pollution and heat dampness. It can also be seen in late onset of summer heat in autumn or in combination with fever and cold. The lung stomach wind heat syndrome is a combination of exterior and interior diseases. Those who are biased towards the surface are affected by wind and cold outside and have multiple symptoms of camp and defense; Those who lean towards the inner side tend to have more symptoms of middle qi. Among them those with a strong emphasis on wind and evil are known as Qi clearing and other phenomena. Those who suffer from severe cold and evil are the Qing Yang lords. If the heat is severe it indicates symptoms of lung stomach and qi. The pathogenesis of the lung stomach wind heat syndrome still belongs to the syndrome of wind evil and external stagnation while heat and internal steaming are the symptoms of external stagnation and internal steaming; External depression cannot be resolved and internal steaming must not be eliminated.

The onset of the disease is sudden and dangerous with a sudden onset of closed syncope. Therefore the term \"heat wind\" refers to the movement of heat and wind also known as heatstroke or heatstroke syncope. Children with weak constitution are most likely to suffer from this syndrome which is similar to infantile convulsion and is also known as acute convulsion. Cheng Xingxuan said \"The cause of the disease is heat generated by summer wind and heat generates shock.\" However it is not convulsion. The heart and liver are all based on blood circulation. When wind and heat affect the heart and liver it must accumulate in blood circulation and there must be multiple blood circulation and Qi and blood diseases; Evil entrapment and blood stasis multiple and severe diseases and difficult to fully resolve cause sudden closure of internal orifices sudden movement of liver wind spasms and seizures. Therefore Cheng Xingxuan said \"Heat is fond of sadness wind is fond of hurting the liver. The heart and liver are internal organs and the internal organs are hidden. Although the evil is difficult to remove it is difficult to recover.\" Therefore the heart liver wind heat syndrome is characterized by acute and severe onset but treatment is difficult to achieve quick results. For those with solid physical condition Cheng claimed that the top ten can save seven or eight indicating that weak individuals are extremely difficult to rescue. The heart liver heat wind syndrome is originally characterized by a change of external depression and internal redness. The condition is severe and acute with slight delay leading to collapse and transformation. The method of treatment is to disperse the cold and depression on the surface when urgent so that internal heat can have a way out. By clearing and cooling the heat the heat inside can be quickly transmitted to the outside avoiding the risk of trapping and causing the mouth to close and move due to wind.",

Mild cases with mild symptoms are referred to as heat stroke syndrome severe cases with acute symptoms are referred to as heat stroke syndrome those with lingering heat are referred to as heat warmth and those with turbid qi are referred to as heat defilement. These are all newly felt heat diseases.

The syndrome of lung and stomach heat dampness always manifests in the upper and middle qi fractions. For those with severe dampness dampness is the evil of yin and turbidity which will inevitably suppress the upper jiao and clear yang. In some cases the yang qi will be blocked and the heat will not reach the outside. However if the inner tunnel is closed it will become a dangerous and severe syndrome. For those with severe heat stroke it is a yang evil. It first depresses the upper energizer and clears qi and then inevitably damages the burning fluid. In some cases it can cause internal steaming of blood. Its transformation or subsidence or internal closure is also often reversed. The pathogenesis of lung and stomach heat dampness syndrome is always stagnation and suppression of the upper jiao qi mechanism. Therefore its treatment principle should always be based on the principle of spicy cool and fragrant and the appropriate expansion of the upper jiao qi mechanism. It is important to promote the expansion of clear qi clear up turbidity and lower it. Then the dampness opens and heat penetrates and the heat dampness resolves itself. Those with heavy dampness often carry cold pathogenic factors suppress yang qi and focus on promoting yang and transforming dampness; Cold and dampness can be relieved and heat can also be relieved as it reaches outside.",

        "description": "The syndrome of lung and spleen heat dampness refers to the inhalation of heat evil into the lungs and the invasion of dampness evil into the spleen. It is a syndrome of lung and spleen heat dampness. Both the lungs and spleen are the main organs of qi so they are known as heat damaging the vital energy or damp heat damaging the qi. Both the lungs and spleen belong to the Tai Yin so they are also known as heat damaging the Tai Yin. In ancient times they were said to drink in the sun and the lungs were the main source of health. In the case of typhoid fever the camp and health were the boundary of the sun and the ancient nickname for drinking heat was also the syndrome of heat damaging the lung and spleen. The syndrome of heat dampness in the lungs and spleen can also be classified as severe heat or dampness; For those with severe heat stroke the injury is shallow and only results in a distinction between moderate and clear qi; Those with severe dampness often carry the yin and cold qi causing severe injuries that can lead to the development of middle qi. Lei Shaoyi said \"Heat injury to the Taiyin difficulty in temper and imbalance in ascending and descending\" is a syndrome of heat injury to the lungs and spleen which can lead to the clearing of yang qi and the loss of its ability to ascend clear and lower turbidity. The imbalance in ascending and descending is its main pathogenesis. The syndrome of lung and spleen heat dampness with severe heat stroke often carries foul and turbid qi. Therefore its treatment principle should be refreshing fragrant cool and mild to relieve heat stroke and dissipate dampness; Aroma to dispel impurities light penetration to promote dampness and stagnation. For those with heavy dampness they often carry yin and cold qi and their treatment should be based on the combination of spicy and warm qi with fragrant and mild qi and the main method is to promote the circulation of yang qi on the surface and inside. He Lianchen said \"For those who experience mild heat but severe cold and dampness heat resides in the cold and dampness absorbed and assimilated by the cold and dampness. Therefore dissipating cold means dissipating heat and treating dampness means treating heat.",

Therefore it is called heat dampness commonly known as sha dampness. Evil invades the middle energizer the spleen is not in charge of ascending the stomach is not in charge of descending the spleen and stomach are out of control the clear and turbid are confused and extravagant and disorderly. The ancients said: \"The clear and turbid are separated by the Jing and Wei meridians and the ascending and descending are out of control; the yin and yang are opposite to the latitude of the sun and moon meridians separated by cold and heat causing great pleasure in the chest causing disorder in the intestines and stomach causing cholera. In some cases the upper and lower parts are obstructed the camp and defense are not effective and the central palace is blocked. Therefore there is a name for heat dampness cholera or heat stroke cholera and those who cannot vomit or diarrhea are called Commonly known as colic. For those with severe heat stroke their illness is relatively shallow and only stagnates in the Qi component which is particularly prone to heat transformation and consumes qi and liquid. For those with severe dampness the disease is deep and has already stagnated in the Yang branch damaging the Yang qi leading to a change in the closure and detachment of the Yang qi. The principle of treatment is always to expel impurities with fragrance to clear heat and remove dampness and to elevate clarity and guide turbidity; For those with a heavy emphasis on dampness they must first open their dampness and then open their dampness to relieve the heat; However for those with both dampness and heat their disease is dampness suppressing and heat burning. They should also use the method of hard work to relieve dampness by activating spleen yang and relieving heat by relieving stomach fire through bitterness.",

The membranous membrane is located near the stomach which is the boundary between half surface and half interior and is a common disease of the gallbladder and stomach. Those who are born in the midst of summer and have a hot and foul atmosphere are called hot and foul; When it occurs during the plum rain it is called moldy dampness; There are also cases of heat stroke with phlegm left in the gallbladder and stomach which is called heat stroke due to qi deficiency. Often carrying the wood fire in the gallbladder and rebelling recklessly. The heat filth dampness and turbidity of qi are absorbed through the mouth and nose traveling straight through the middle path obscuring the upper and middle clear qi and cannot be spread inside and outside. They are often caused by the same disease on the surface and inside with pathogenic factors gathering and blocking the pivot resulting in unfavorable pivot rotation. Wet retention lasts for a long time dampness and turbidity generate phlegm and stagnation obstructs the stomach meridians. The heat moves the gallbladder and the wood fire while the rebellion in the middle is a sign of transformation. The heat dampness and filth are accumulated in the membrane and the clear qi does not expand. Although ancient people called it the boundary of nearly half the surface and half the interior it is different from Shaoyang's half surface and half the interior. Shaoyang should be in harmony with Jieshu Ji while this certificate should be cleared and cleared. Therefore Wu Kun'an said \"The Mu Yuan is located near the stomach forming a boundary between half the surface and half the interior. Cold and heat are like malaria chest tightness and Shaoyang is half the surface and half the interior. The treatment is suitable for clearing and dispersing Mu Yuan such as Huoxiang Yujin betel nut Houpu Grass cardamom Qingpi Talcum Forsythia Perilla and Scutellaria baicalensis. The spicy fragrance is warmed to penetrate and reach Mu Yuan. Therefore the treatment should be based on hard work fragrant light promoting heat dampness and dispersing Mu Yuan to remove turbidity; Quickly penetrate and dispel the evil within people.

Or due to exposure to rain or wind or exposure to mist and dew mild cases are called dampness severe cases are called dampness similar to a cold so it is also called a cold. If there is a symptom of head clearing it is called dampness injury on the upper part or fog injury on the upper part dampness evil on the upper part persistent for a long time or constant headache it is called scalp wind. If there are symptoms of meridian symptoms it is called Bi Tong or Tong Bi which is always caused by rheumatism stagnation on the surface of the body. Lung Wei rheumatism syndrome has two pathogenesis: either external injury mainly due to the stagnation of yang qi in excess of Wei which is a superficial syndrome of rheumatism; Or injury to the upper body mainly due to the stagnation of qi that suppresses the clear yang of the upper jiao is a symptom that can be seen both externally and internally; Furthermore there is a bias towards wind and dampness which can be divided into two categories: qi stagnation and yang stagnation; In the Qi fraction the disease is shallow and mild while in the Yang fraction the evil is heavy and deep; If the dampness remains unsolved it will stagnate the meridians and even cause qi stagnation and blood stasis due to qi and blood. If it lasts for a long time it will become a chronic disease that is difficult to cure. The pathogenic stagnation of rheumatism on the surface or on the surface is always due to the inability of Yang Qi to spread. Therefore the treatment principle should always prioritize the dredging of rheumatism; The medicine is taken with hard work warm dispersion and a combination of fragrant and light substances. The medicine is taken with bitterness to dissipate wind bitterness to dry and damp fragrance to dissolve turbidity and light to permeate dampness; However if yin dampness harms yang it is always advisable to let it go with the wind. But do not sweat profusely as sweat will blow away without removing dampness. Therefore Zhong Jing once said \"If you treat rheumatism you will sweat but if you feel like you want to sweat all rheumatism will go away. If you sweat profusely but the wind will go away and the moisture will also be there.\" Lei Shaoyi also said \"In the morning the mist and mist will cause damage to the mountain mist. It is advisable to expel the dampness on the surface and take a small amount of sweat imitating the meaning of Yu Jiayan's saying that you are not expensive Xu is not expensive",

The initial disease is often characterized by both external and internal factors; Wind damages the lungs dampness belongs to the spleen and both the lungs and spleen belong to the Tai Yin. The ancients referred to it as Tai Yin rheumatism or Tai Yin cold or Tai Yin stroke. The pathogenesis of lung and spleen rheumatism syndrome is mainly characterized by stagnation and suppression of the qi of clearing yang in the upper jiao. If clearing yang is not suitable for expansion it cannot occur in the striae on the outside and does not control the rise and fall of the lung and spleen on the inside. Therefore it is a common disease on the surface and inside. If the lung qi does not decrease it cannot flow its body fluid for the spleen to descend the waterway; If one's temper does not rise one's health luck will be negligent; Rheumatism carries moisture and qi which leads down the large intestine to cause depression and depression; Edema due to stasis due to extravasation of the striae muscle; Staying stagnant in the camp and guard is a rash; Staying in the tendons and veins resulting in blockage of the collaterals and stagnation of qi and blood resulting in flaccidity. The treatment of lung spleen rheumatism syndrome involves two methods: external evacuation and infiltration in order to decompose its external and internal pathogens. Zhang Zhongjing said \"A stroke in the Taiyin region can cause sweating \" which is a method of clearing the yang and muscles to penetrate the pathogenic factors of rheumatism. Wu Kun'an on the other hand said: \"Dampness evil lies on the surface of muscle drive and it is suitable to relieve muscle infiltration and dampness.\" This is why the two major methods for promoting yang qi are to disperse it and to dissipate it with light infiltration and clear circulation which are the two main methods for lung and spleen rheumatism.",

It is often caused by the feeling of rheumatism without onset or by the gradual deepening of the disease after treatment. Therefore it is often referred to as' Fu Feng 'or' Fu Shi '. Wind energy is transmitted to the liver while dampness is attributed to the spleen. Those who are shallow in depth are still in the Qi division. Both the liver and spleen are responsible for the rise of clear Yang Qi while rheumatism is stagnant. The liver and spleen cannot lift up so it is often used to clear Qi and reduce diuresis. The Inner Canon states: \"When the pure qi is in the lower level there is a special release In addition the spleen and liver are both responsible for blood circulation and rheumatism invaginates and often accumulates in the blood circulation resulting in various diseases such as macula. The liver governs the tendons the spleen governs the muscles and rheumatism stays in the meridians and obstructs the meridians. The liver sign rheumatism syndrome is a syndrome where rheumatism accumulates in the liver and spleen and cannot be released. Therefore its treatment should always be based on evacuation and light infiltration with internal and external dissipation as the method. The external part should be evacuated to support and penetrate rheumatism allowing it to escape from the surface; the internal part should be infiltrated to facilitate the branching of waterways Guide dampness evil from below. However dampness is a yin evil and will inevitably lead to stagnation of yang qi. Therefore the main method is to promote yang while wind is a yang evil.

Due to its deep pathogenic disease it is difficult to quickly eliminate and can easily lead to stubborn and stubborn changes. The liver governs the tendons while the kidney governs the bones. Rheumatism affects the liver and kidneys and often affects the muscles and bones causing pain to become arthralgia; The liver follows the hypochondrium and the kidneys are located at the waist. Both the liver and kidneys are responsible for the foot and knee and are related to the anterior yin. Therefore its symptoms are more common in the waist hypochondrium back foot knee or anterior yin; However the liver is mainly responsible for blood circulation and the Wei originates from the lower energizer. Therefore the flow of dampness and heat to the liver and kidneys can also cause imbalance between the liver and Wei disharmony between qi and blood and lead to systemic muscle and bone pain. Liver and kidney rheumatism syndrome although the disease is deeply immersed in the lower energizer its treatment principle should still be based on promoting yang release and dispersing to eliminate the pathogenic factors of depression and to propose external transmission is the best strategy; People with deep evil spirits are eager but unable to quickly rise; Especially if there is blood circulation inside it will inevitably lead to qi and blood stasis and then the circulation of blood stasis and collaterals is essential; If someone has already passed through tunnels and bones they should also be searched by insects and ants.

When cold and dampness are first encountered they always carry the wind so the cold and dampness surface syndrome was also known as rheumatic external infection in ancient times or wind cold carrying dampness. Cold and dampness affect the external environment leading to the stagnation of yang and yang. It is similar to the wind cold external syndrome but it also carries dampness and evil external stagnation. The affliction of new sensations is easy to dissolve but if it is delayed and untreated dampness remains on the surface stagnates the camp and defense and the meridian qi and blood cannot be propagated resulting in the syndrome of Bi and gout. The ancients called the combination of wind cold and dampness as Bi the winner of cold as Tong Bi and the winner of dampness as Bi which is the transformation syndrome of lung cold and dampness. The syndrome of cold and dampness on the surface is divided into Wei Yang and Wei Yang. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to promote the circulation of Wei Yang and encourage Wei Yang. If Wei Yang can be propagated then cold and dampness will also dissipate and both cold and dampness can be eliminated through sweat.",

Cold originates from the stomach and becomes a syndrome of cold dampness stagnation in the upper and middle yang qi; Commonly known as cold and dampness due to colds mild cases refer to excessive dampness severe cases refer to dampness due to dampness. Yu Genchu referred to it as cold and epidemic which occurs before the autumnal equinox with filthy dampness and is also an example of cold and dampness. In summer when it occurs due to excessive coolness it is commonly known as Yin Sha; Fetal malaria in children also has symptoms of lung and stomach cold dampness. Due to the accumulation of cold and dampness in the lungs and stomach it is often caused by mistakenly administering cold and causing yin coagulation. Cold and dampness stagnation occurs in the lungs and stomach first suppressing the yang qi of the upper and middle jiao. The lungs and stomach are occupied by the clear yang qi which is lost in the spreading of the clear yang qi and cannot pass through the barrier and the Wei yang cannot be cleared resulting in the surface syndrome of cold and dampness in the lungs and stomach; The inability to promote the qi lowering mechanism within and the inability to clear and clear the orifices above can result in external and internal symptoms of lung stomach cold and dampness. Therefore the treatment principle should always be to promote the circulation of yang qi in the upper and middle energizers which is the method of bitter bitter warm and dry. The external dispersion and internal dryness are the major methods of promoting the circulation of yang qi; If the qi of the clear yang can be propagated then the external striae will appear and the internal expansion and elevation will occur.

Both lungs and spleen belong to the Tai Yin so they are called dampness retention Tai Yin or also known as the Tai Yin meridian syndrome. In the summer moon it is also known as Yin heat stroke also known as typhoid fever or cold fever. Its symptoms may include diarrhea dysentery cholera malaria jaundice and other miscellaneous diseases. Cold dampness suppresses the lungs and spleen and the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle cannot be spread inside and outside. On the outside the Wei Yang is lost in propaganda while on the inside the Qi mechanism is lost and should be lowered.

It is often caused by excessive consumption of raw and cold fruits tea wine and other substances which can damage the spleen and stomach yang qi cannot transport and transform water and stagnates into dampness. It is an endogenous dampness; Or more susceptible to external cold the combination of internal and external pathogenic factors can lead to internal injury cold and dampness; The onset of the disease varies in severity. Those with acute symptoms are called moderate dampness also known as moderate cold while those with mild symptoms are called dampness filthy dampness and latent dampness. Cold and dampness accumulate in the middle energizer with the most frequent symptoms of transformation. Urgent symptoms can lead to diarrhea dysentery and cholera while mild symptoms can lead to symptoms such as jaundice malaria swelling bloating and bloody stools making it the most complex syndrome in cold and dampness syndrome. Therefore when urgent there is a risk of blackout while when slow there is a change in stubborn nature. Cold dampness and yin evil can cause damage to the yang qi of the spleen and stomach when the person is in the middle energizer. In mild cases the qi of the spleen and stomach is stagnant and clear and cannot be conveyed inside and outside. Instead it is an internal syndrome that combines external and internal symptoms and is a common disease between external and internal symptoms; If it is severe it will cause the spleen yang to be unable to circulate its body fluid for the stomach and the body fluid cannot transform qi into water resulting in indistinguishable water and grain; Either it passes down the large intestine and becomes diarrhea or dysentery or it stays in the triple energizer and becomes swollen or swollen or it becomes yellow or malaria for a long time; For those who are in a state of urgency they block the yang qi and become a closed syncope with moderate cold and moderate dampness; Or disrupt the clear yang reverse the chaotic qi mechanism confuse the clear and turbid and become a profligate and disorderly cholera. The spleen and stomach cold and dampness syndrome is a pathogenic factor of yin turbidity which leads to the transformation of yang qi in stagnation. Therefore its treatment principle should first warm and unblock the spleen and stomach yang qi with the main focus on dispersing cold and dampness; When the middle yang vibrates it can stir up the qi of clearing yang causing external wrinkles internal waterways and internal decomposition; If the cold and dampness are eliminated the clear yang will rise while the turbid yin will decrease. The rise and fall will return to their normal state and the inversion can be flattened while the depression can be lifted. Therefore the key lies in the method of transportation center.",

        "description": "The spleen kidney cold dampness syndrome is characterized by the spleen dampness flowing down to the kidneys or the cold dampness receiving from below. The cold dampness invades the spleen and kidneys resulting in the stagnation of yang qi in the spleen and kidneys. If the dampness stagnates in the kidneys then the kidney yang is suppressed. It cannot transform qi to reach the bladder for promoting dampness and water circulation and cannot fumigate the spleen soil causing the spleen yang to lose its right to health. Yin is abundant and yang is depressed but yang is not transformed into yin or yin is turbid and dry up and yin is in the yang position. It is an ancient disease known as wind deficiency. If it stagnates in the spleen the spleen will lose its circulation and the water and valleys will not be different. If it persists for a long time the fluid will liquefy and overflow and accumulate internally which is a symptom of yin water; Staying outside or in the camp can cause stagnation of camp blood; Yang deficiency cannot be resolved but becomes yin spots and blood stasis; Or if left in the meridian tunnel it may indicate chills or hemiplegia; Downflow to the kidneys suppressing kidney yang is a syndrome of urinary incontinence kidney stagnation flaccidity impotence cold hernia and numbness of the kidneys. Spleen dampness flows down or dampness is received from below which stagnates kidney yang cannot fumigate spleen soil above cannot transform qi and bladder below causing cold and dampness to remain in the middle and lower two jiao. Therefore the rule of law lies in warming and activating the kidney yang. When the kidney yang is activated the spleen yang is also healthy which can transport water and dampness and lower the bladder; When kidney yang is converted into qi the waterways are smooth and the water dampness is self regulating. However the disease has become deeply debilitating and often leads to lingering difficulties that can be quickly resolved. Even if it persists it often becomes a persistent disease.",

        "description": "The liver and spleen cold dampness syndrome is often caused by the stagnation of spleen dampness and liver yang. Spleen dampness is too excessive and it accumulates in the liver causing numbness and lack of vitality. Cold starts from the inside and cold and dampness compete causing stagnation of the liver and spleen. Both the liver and spleen are mainly responsible for blood circulation so it can cause stagnation of blood circulation and become a disease of arthralgia and pain. If the internal stagnation of cold and dampness occurs or if it occurs in the spleen then the liver wood will multiply in the spleen causing stomach pain abdominal pain diarrhea jaundice swelling and other diseases; Or if it stagnates in the liver the spleen dampness will be suppressed in the liver causing the liver's vitality to stagnate and the liver's yang to stagnate leading to syncope; Or gynecological diseases such as menstrual pain amenorrhea and yin blowing. Cold dampness stagnates the liver and spleen and yin turbidity is abundant within resulting in a lack of vitality. Therefore the treatment principle is always based on the method of nourishing yang and discharging turbidity. The medicine is used to remove the cold dampness caused by yin turbidity and to stimulate the vitality of liver yang which is what Yu Genchu called the method of clearing yang and reaching stagnation. When the yang qi of the liver is vibrated it can clear and benefit the spleen soil. When the spleen dampness is opened there is no problem of obstructing the liver wood. The spleen yang naturally vibrates and the health and transportation have the power. There is no residual worry of dampness and turbidity. However if the Yin Qi is too strong it should not be infused with cold and cool nourishment so that as the Yin grows and the Yang dissipates it will inevitably undergo transformation.",

        "description": "Lung and stomach dampness heat syndrome is one of the major syndromes in dampness heat syndrome. In addition to feeling seasonal dampness heat it includes heat pollution mold dampness dampness and turbidity foul and foul qi malaria and sha qi. There are also warm diseases with dampness such as wind temperature spring temperature winter temperature as well as typhoid and sha summer wind with dampness and turbidity and heat injury with food. In addition the dampness and heat transformation such as dampness and summer heat are all caused by dampness heat in the lung and stomach. Therefore there are many sources of this disease and its symptoms are also complex. The evil of dampness and heat originates from the mouth and nose and first accumulates in the upper jiao. It suppresses the qi of clearing yang and prevents it from producing external striae while regulating the qi mechanism internally. Therefore dampness and heat in the lungs and stomach are often characterized by a combination of external and internal factors. Those with a strong emphasis on heat and evil will experience stagnation and stagnation of qi; Those with a heavy emphasis on dampness and evil will inevitably experience stagnation and yang suppression both of which are symptoms of dampness suppressing heat and steaming. If one is unable to overcome depression it can turn into stagnation. Stagnation persists either against the top trapped in the bottom or trapped in the middle and even transforms into symptoms of stagnation or syncope. If the stagnation of heat persists for a long time it will turn into a period of accumulation of steam and accumulation of heat. It can cause damage to the body and consume fluids and in some cases it can deeply divide the body's blood while qi and blood are both steamed together; Or go deep into the Yin division and eliminate the burning of Yin fluid resulting in a state of Qi and Yin steaming together. If the actor consumes gas and liquid it can also cause a change of detachment. The transmission and transformation of the latent evil originating from within are somewhat similar but they are also mostly due to the entanglement of the Qi component which is difficult to quickly resolve and can easily penetrate into the blood and Yin components. This is slightly different from the new sense of evil. The treatment principle for lung stomach dampness heat syndrome is as follows: the initial disease should be mild and bitter and the upper jiao qi should be released to reach pathogenic factors; For a long time it will be bitter bitter and cool while for a light time it will be beneficial and sunny. In addition aroma is essential for resolving turbidity bitter warmth is essential for dryness and dampness bitterness is essential for relieving heat and sweetness is essential for promoting diuresis in the lung and stomach dampness heat syndrome. The pathogenesis of dampness and heat stagnation in the lung and stomach is always related to the qi of clearing yang in the upper energizer. Therefore the first step is to release the qi of the upper energizer and once the yang is cleared it can reach the muscle striae on the outside to relieve symptoms while on the inside it can promote the qi and flow through the waterways. This is the method of Wu Jutong's \"Xuanhua Quxie still from the surface\". Therefore Ye Lin said \"If the surface is not clear it should not be clear. It is appropriate to declare the division of qi.\" Wu Kun'an said \"The evil of dampness is obstructed by the division of qi and heat comes from dampness. Only using heat clearing drugs should not be used. It is appropriate to separate dampness from qi and heat should be eliminated by itself.\" He Lianchen also said; The main method is to gently clear and open the lungs with the lungs governing the entire body's qi. The transformation of lung qi leads to the spontaneous transformation of spleen dampness. As long as the ventilation is separated the qi is divided into dampness and dampness is removed and heat is self stopped. \"Yu Genchu also said \" The method of light and clear fr",

The dampness and heat stagnation of the lung and spleen can initially suppress the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle parts of the body. Clearing yang cannot be propagated and it is not suitable to have striae on the outside. The qi lowering mechanism cannot be propagated on the inside and the descending water channel can facilitate the circulation of the three jiao; Damp and hot steaming either steamed outside left in the middle or trapped below hot steaming outside still has the potential to reach outside; Those who remain in the middle stagnate the qi mechanism and block it inside; Even if the body fluid is stagnant it stops and melts into water overflows on the skin muscles and knees and is stored inside the membrane and outside the intestine it is difficult to quickly remove. The dampness and heat stagnation of the lungs and spleen prevents the release of the upper and middle clear yang qi. Therefore the treatment principle should always be to release the upper and middle clear yang qi as the main source and the external area can be affected by striae allowing the dampness and heat to escape from sweat; The internal waterways can be used to promote dampness and heat from a young age. Xie Yinglu said \"Sweating can promote water retention and the evil of Buddha's depression can be resolved both externally and internally.\" He Lianchen also said \"The treatment method is mainly to gently open the lung qi which controls the whole body's qi. When the lung qi is transformed the spleen dampness will self transform and sweat will flow simultaneously. Naturally dampness will open and heat will penetrate and both the exterior and interior will be resolved.",

        "description": "The gallbladder stomach dampness heat syndrome is a type of dampness heat that accumulates in the membrane and serves as the pivot for the stagnation and suppression of yang and the rise and fall of yang. It is the boundary between the exterior and interior and was formerly known as the division of Shaoyang and Yangming. It is often caused by the accumulation of qi heat and dampness or the accumulation of dampness and warmth or the accumulation of heat; There are also new infections of dampness and turbid qi which travel directly from the mouth and nose to the middle canal and accumulate in the membrane. It is most likely to transform from Shaoyang ulceration to malaria and there are also cases of transmission of jaundice. There is also this syndrome of typhoid fever causing chest fatigue. The dampness heat syndrome of the gallbladder and stomach is often caused by the sensation of heat dampness and turbidity. It is inhaled through the mouth and nose runs straight through the middle channel and accumulates in the source of energy. It starts from the collapse of Shaoyang and in cases of severe dampness it often suppresses the pivot mechanism and loses its ability to pivot. In some cases it stagnates from stagnation to stagnation resulting in stagnation; Those with severe heat tend to experience stagnation and steaming inside and in some cases it can be caused by Qi causing blood to ignite wood fire and steam inside. The dampness heat syndrome of the gallbladder and stomach is a syndrome of dampness heat and turbid evil which accumulates in the source and cannot be transmitted externally. Therefore its treatment principle should always be based on bitterness bitterness and light infiltration to promote dampness and heat to dredge and nourish the source and to prevent the hidden evil from reaching the outside; Dingganren Day; It is advisable to reconcile Xuanhua dilute the infiltration of dampness and heat so that evil can flow from the outside and dampness can flow from the bottom so that the camp and defense can be reconciled and the cold and heat can resolve themselves. \"He Xiushan also said \" Open up the Mu Yuan so that the evil can collapse from the outside and the heat can penetrate from the outside. \"Wu Kun'an said even further \" When you urgently open up otherwise you will close the middle jiao and cannot reach the Mu Yuan",

It is often a disease of dampness and heat due to the accumulation of pathogenic factors. It also has a new sensation of autumn warmth and dryness with dampness depression on the outside and heat steaming on the inside hence it is also known as the syndrome of dampness heat reduction and accumulation. The dampness suppresses more than the Wei the heat multiplies in the camp the Wei points cannot be resolved and it is transmitted through the Qi points; If the camp division is not understood it will be transmitted to the blood division and even deeply trapped in the yin division; Damp and stagnant qi often produce phlegm while heat and blood often stop stasis. Therefore the lung liver dampness heat syndrome often carries phlegm and blood stasis as a disease. The pathogenesis of lung liver dampness heat syndrome is characterized by dampness stagnation on the outside and heat retention on the inside. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to promote the transformation of dampness evil clear and penetrate the dampness evil so that the dampness evil suppressed by stagnation can be opened and the evil accumulated in the qi camp can be thoroughly resolved; Cao Bingzhang said \"First release dampness and heat then penetrate from the inside to the outside This heat is trapped inside dampness is suppressed outside and there are many symptoms such as summer heat autumn plague and autumn dryness. The treatment method for this syndrome is to use silkworm excrement talcum Gualou skin and Yu Jin to dissipate turbidity and promote qi and qi stagnation. Fresh ground fermented soybeans artemisia annua white wei and Jiaoshan gardenia are used to clear and nourish heat from the outside and dampness and heat are transmitted.

        "description": "Spleen and stomach dampness heat syndrome is mostly caused by internal injury with a particular emphasis on internal and external combined evils. Internal injury dampness evil such as overeating gaoliang wine meat tea and fruits can accumulate dampness and accumulate in the middle energizer which lingers in the spleen and stomach and causes the disease. Exogenous seasonal dampness and heat such as summer dampness filth mold dampness and scab are new pathogenic factors. Feeling without emitting accumulating in the interior transforming into warmth and heat such as dampness heatstroke and dampness is considered to suppress evil. The onset of seasonal evils is often caused by both external and internal diseases; The onset of dampness and heat caused by internal injuries is often associated with external seasonal pathogens combined with internal and external pathogens and is often a miscellaneous disease; Especially common are diarrhea dysentery cholera abdominal distension and pain which often transform into acute and chronic miscellaneous diseases such as jaundice swelling bloating malaria bloating flaccidity and arthralgia. It is a syndrome of dampness and heat in the spleen and stomach and the diseases it belongs to are also very widespread. Exogenous new pathogens run directly from the mouth and nose to the middle channel accumulating in the middle jiao. They are combined with internal dampness to suppress the spleen and stomach causing the loss of the power to ascend and descend the middle qi. The ability to clear yang is lost and the ability to promote and expand qi cannot be promoted externally. The internal cannot promote and lower qi so there are many mixed symptoms on the surface and inside. The pathogenesis changes either due to Buddha stagnation in the interior stagnation in the interior inversion in the upper part stagnation in the lower part or stagnation in the middle and even disorder in ascending and descending confusion in clearing and turbidity blockage of the middle yang all of which are changes of the same disease on the surface and inside. The dampness and heat caused by internal injuries can stagnate in the stomach resulting in a disharmony of stomach qi. In some cases the disharmony of the stomach can lead to a downward trend and an upward trend leading to stagnation in the stomach meridians and loss of its circulation; If it stagnates in the spleen it will lose its normal health and circulation unable to distinguish between water and grain secreting clear and turbid fluids causing dereliction of circulation and transformation or stagnation in the middle or internal organs all of which are acute and chronic miscellaneous diseases. The treatment of spleen and stomach dampness heat syndrome is always based on dredging the middle energizer and clearing away dampness and heat. Pu Fuzhou said \"Clearing dampness and heat regulating the spleen and stomach dredging the three jiao and using bitter and spicy herbs.\" Ye Tianshi once said \"Dampness and heat are not bitter spicy cold and insoluble.\" However those with a heavy degree of dampness and turbidity are not bitter bitter spicy warm and dry and cannot pass through yang and dissipate turbidity; For those who suffer from food stagnation it is better to dredge up the energy and focus on food stagnation; For those who suffer from both deficiency and deficiency they should also support the spleen to assist in its movement and transformation. Ma Yuanyi once said \"The internal injury of qi is sufficient to cause yin and evil and the attack is sufficient to cause qi damage. The appropriate way to supplement it is to stagnate evil.\" It also said \"If you supplement deficiency the heat will not be removed and if you treat evil the deficiency will not be taken care of.\" However \"If you supplement and disperse evil the transportation will be up and down.\" To regulate and supplement it.",

        "description": "Gastrointestinal dampness heat syndrome is a type of gastrointestinal disease where dampness heat flows from the stomach to the intestines. The dampness heat flows from the middle jiao to the lower jiao resulting in a combination of the middle and lower jiao. It can also be inhaled by a new sensation causing turbid dampness heat to pass directly through the middle canal to the human stomach or due to the accumulation of dampness and heat which occurs when the yang ming is not resolved and then flows into the intestines. Therefore it is known as the dampness blocking qi mechanism or the dampness accumulating in the lower jiao. In miscellaneous diseases diarrhea and dysentery are more common and can also develop into bloating or malaria. Gastrointestinal dampness heat syndrome the evil of dampness heat originates from the stomach and intestines and when it is in contact with the water and grains in the stomach it often contains food and phlegm; Combined with intestinal waste it becomes stagnant; Those with severe heat tend to stagnate in the Qi component blocking the gastrointestinal Qi mechanism and even causing damage to the blood component due to Qi; Those with heavy dampness often carry external cold causing depression to damage yang qi; If the evil is severe it is often associated with phlegm food and dross accumulation and is more entangled. Damp heat flows from the stomach to the intestines competing with the water and grains in the stomach and the dross in the intestines. It is mostly solid evil and difficult to penetrate from the outside. It must be a false intestinal tract as a way out and the evil will be eliminated through feces. Yu Genchu said \"When bitterness and bitterness are reduced they will be eliminated through feces.\" Especially for those who suffer from internal collapse of evil they attach themselves to the dross in the intestines and are the most difficult to quickly eliminate. Therefore as the Yu family once said \"Evil forces emerge endlessly often slowing down repeatedly and then clearing and benefiting four times and the evil forces begin to dissipate.\" It also said \"Once the accumulated dirt descends five or six times until seven or eight times and the evil forces begin to dissipate. However if dampness and heat do not compete with tangible objects but only hinder the gastrointestinal qi mechanism then the main approach should be to dissipate dampness and ventilate. Although it is called ventilation it also uses the pseudo two intestines as the outlet. Shao Xiangen said \"Dampness obstructs the qi mechanism and the treatment is to infiltrate dampness and open qi. If the evil of the stagnation of the lower jiao is enlightened then the two will pass through and the evil will self transform",

However if the liver qi cannot be released it can also lead to the obstruction of the stomach and the loss of qi leading to the development of liver stomach syndrome. The liver is Jueyin with Shaoyang as the exterior and interior and is the pivot of the main qi mechanism. The liver qi is suppressed by dampness and the pivot mechanism is also affected by the pivot failure. The liver is responsible for storing blood dampness stagnation outside heat steaming inside mostly from qi and blood and Jueyin sends phase fire with dampness and heat steaming causing the phase fire to be unstable in position resulting in the inversion of wood fire; If dampness and heat remain the liver qi will accumulate in the stomach causing the stomach organs to lose their ability to clear and lower. If it becomes chronic it will be difficult to delay. Liver and stomach dampness heat syndrome dampness heat stagnation in the liver and stomach loss of liver qi in relieving and loss of stomach qi in descending. Therefore its treatment principle should focus on clearing dampness and heat relieving liver qi clearing and lowering stomach qi and harmonizing the liver and stomach as the method; Ding Ganren said \"Reconcile Shaoyang to release Jue Yin smooth Qi flow and clear Yang",

        "description": "The dampness heat syndrome of the liver and spleen is often caused by excessive dampness in the spleen obstructing the liver and causing the spleen and liver to have the same disease. The spleen is a damp soil mainly responsible for transporting and transforming fluid qi the liver stores fire and mainly deals with blood; Liver numbness is caused by dampness in the spleen and the vitality of the liver is not active which cannot be released to the spleen. The spleen lacks the ability to transport and transform and dampness stagnation is even more severe; Prolonged stagnation transforms heat further carrying the wood fire of the liver resulting in dampness stagnation and heat steaming. The spleen governs the qi of the body while the liver stores blood. If it is biased towards the spleen it is a symptom of stagnation of qi. The liver is characterized by blood stasis and steaming. And the liver is the Jueyin with Shaoyang as the exterior and interior jointly controlling the pivot of the Qi mechanism. Dampness and heat stagnation in the liver can also cause the pivot to rotate disadvantageously. If dampness and evil are severe there will be more stagnation changes. Dampness and heat stagnation in the spleen and the spleen lacks the ability to transport and transform. If the Jin Qi stagnates it will stop storing water; If it is delayed and untreated and water and qi are intertwined it will become a stubborn disease of bloating. Stagnation in the liver leads to the loss of liver qi for relaxation which runs counter to the spleen and stomach and can even cause stagnation of the liver's blood vessels often becoming a chronic disease. The dampness heat syndrome of the liver and spleen is often caused by dampness stagnation in the spleen heat stagnation in the liver and dampness suppressing heat stagnation. Therefore its treatment principle is to use bitter and bitter herbs to cool and dilute bitter and bitter herbs to open dampness stagnation and cool and dilute to clear and dissipate heat in dampness. Lei Shaoyi said \"Let the dampness in the interior go from urination.\" He Lianchen said \"Those who have not yet melted the fire the bitter and bitter herbs are light and warm; those who have already melted the fire the bitter and bitter herbs are light and clear.\" For those who have a strong internal fire it should also be combined with the method of clearing and descending so that the stagnant fire can go from the large intestine. For those who engage in blood circulation it is more important to clear and purify the blood circulation so that it can be converted into qi and dissolved. In short dampness and heat stagnate the liver and spleen and the mechanism of liver and spleen qi is lost in relieving stress. Therefore it is always advisable to prioritize soothing the liver and benefiting the spleen.",

        "description": "The syndrome of lung and stomach warming and dryness is a combination of dryness and warm heat. It is milder in comparison to warm heat syndrome and heavier in comparison to wind dryness syndrome. Wind dryness can transform heat into warm dryness and warm dryness can also transform heat into dry heat. It is different from the wind dryness caused by wind heat also known as warm dryness. The disease often occurs in early autumn when the climate is warm and hot and the combination of autumn temperature and autumn dryness becomes a syndrome of warm dryness; Or by autumn warmth or wind dryness excessive administration of Xin San consumption of body fluids and transformation of dryness can also turn into lung and stomach warm dryness. Warmth and dryness can damage the lungs and stomach. First it consumes the lung fluid and stomach fluid causing the stomach to be unable to flow water to the lungs resulting in even drier lung qi; If there is a lack of body fluid in the lungs to apply there will be no mist or dew to irrigate. Therefore although the warming and dryness may damage the upper and middle lungs and stomach the pathological changes lie in the lung's fluid qi causing the lungs to lose the right to subdue and then consume gastric fluid. If delayed and untreated again it will eventually damage the yin fluid. In case of urgency it can be forwarded to critical and serious symptoms such as diphtheria. In case of delay it can transform into pulmonary impotence and tuberculosis causing damage to the portal area. Lung-stomach warming dryness syndrome although warming dryness harms the upper and middle lungs and stomach its onset is more common in the lungs as the ancients called \"dryness harms the lungs\". Therefore its treatment should mainly focus on clearing the lungs and moistening dryness which is the method that Ye Tianshi called \"sweet cold moistening and descending to eliminate lung and gold\". Yu Genchu said \"Gan Run complements Xin Run dissipates phlegm and generates fluid to expel phlegm.\" Chao Chongshan also said \"Fire floats on the top but clearing and purifying is not enough. Urgent clearing and purifying can only alleviate phlegm and moisten dryness",

        "description": "The lung and stomach dryness heat syndrome is the fundamental disease of the dryness heat syndrome and is a syndrome where the evil of dryness heat evaporates and burns on the lung and stomach qi. Wind dryness and warm dryness cannot be treated and heat is transmitted to the lungs and stomach; The syndrome of heat deficiency caused by the mistake of transforming heat into dryness due to typhoid fever or warm heat which is transmitted from the differentiation of qi in the lungs and stomach as well as the syndrome of heat directly invading the lungs and stomach or the syndrome of excessive temperature heat and dry heat leading to the collapse of yang ming qi can all become this syndrome which is referred to as the yang ming syndrome in the \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases\" and the syndrome of hand Taiyin warmth and heat qi division dryness heat syndrome and lung stomach dryness heat syndrome. As a pathogenic factor of dryness and heat it is steamed and burned in the upper and middle qi fractions with the main pathogenesis being the elimination and burning of lung and stomach fluids. In mild cases it is steamed in the upper jiao to clear qi and fluid and is subjected to heat steaming; The heavy heat belongs to the middle energizer mainly focused on the stomach and internal organs. Yu Genchu once said \"Evil heat is transmitted to the stomach meridian with external muscle striae internal liver and gallbladder upper heart and lung and lower small intestine and bladder. They are all steamed and burned by it but they are scattered and invisible dry heat which has not yet become strong.\" In the dry heat the body fluid is boiled either burning up and down or forced down or disturbed in the middle and the ascending and descending are disordered mixed with clearing and turbidity resulting in various symptoms such as vomiting diuresis and cholera. Dramatists close their minds internally and suddenly move their liver wind. The so-called Yang Ming dryness generates wind changes. Chen Pingbo said \"When the fire moves the wind generates wind when the wind is fanned the fire becomes fiery. When the governor's meridians are channeled outside they become spasms and when they are channeled up in the brain they faint.\" Or if the qi component cannot be fully resolved it will inevitably sink into human blood. Ye Tianshi said \"The heat and evil of the qi component have not gone and gradually pass on to human blood components \" and there are two Pan Qi and blood syndromes. The above are all changes in evil reality. The dryness and heat in the upper and middle regions inevitably consume the lung and stomach fluids causing damage to the vital energy. Therefore there is a transformation of excess evil and deficiency. Xu Huixi said \"The extreme heat leads to the withering of the body fluids \" and Yu Jiayan also said \"Like a fire setting fire to a prairie the body fluids flow inside.\" Wu Kun'an said \"Warming evil damages the lung and stomach fluids and the body fluids in the stomach dry up. Even more so as Wu Jutong once said \"Yin liquid and energy are both injured.\" This shows that the lung and stomach are dry and hot causing the first injury to the fluid and qi consuming the gas and liquid and ultimately damaging the qi and yin. This is a transformation from solid to deficiency. Urgent symptoms can lead to closure and detachment while slow symptoms can lead to persistent illnesses such as choking and thirst. The principle of treatment is to remove heat and save the fluid in the lungs and stomach by steaming and cauterizing the lung stomach and stomach fluids. Therefore the first step is to remove heat and save the fluid that is to urgently clear and eliminate the dry heat in the lungs and stomach and to save the body fluid in the lungs and stomach as the main task. The ancient people had a saying that \"if you save a portion of the body fluid you will get a portion of the evil heat.\" Since ancient times the use of spicy and cool heavy agents to clear and clear the dry heat is the main method and the use of sweet and cold to save the fluid is the auxili",

        "description": "The syndrome of dryness and heat in the heart and lungs is characterized by the accumulation of heat and heat in the body due to qi or by the accumulation of heat and heat in the body due to the collapse of qi. Both are symptoms of the exchange of qi and heat and the new sensation of heat and heat is caused by the mouth and nose with the lungs receiving the evil first and the stomach and intestines passing through it in the right direction ultimately resulting in the accumulation of qi. If the internal transmission of the human camp is superior to the heart it is called a reverse transmission therefore it is called a bad certificate. However due to the scorching heat in the summer the external collapse of the camp and the transformation of the qi are transmitted in a clockwise manner and cannot be called a bad symptom. It is always a heart and lung disease. The lung governs qi while the heart governs blood which belongs to the qi camp. The beginning lies in the qi camp and the end can consume the injured camp fluid. If delayed and untreated the internal closure of the dry fire can lead to syncope and detachment. Heart and lung dryness heat syndrome where dryness heat accumulates in the heart and lungs and those with mild pathogenic factors and shallow diseases tend to disturb the qi distribution either by clearing the channels through the upper trunk or by disturbing the heart and mind internally; Those with severe pathogenic diseases tend to be more intense than those with severe symptoms. At the beginning it will be steamed and burned in the qi camp but after a long time it will burn the camp fluid. In severe cases it will undergo internal closure and external detachment. The main pathogenesis of the heart lung dryness heat syndrome is heat burning qi camp so its treatment principle is always based on clearing and breathable camp: clearing and moistening lung dryness cooling and penetrating heart camp. He Xiushan has said: \"It is advisable to use the method of Xin Runda evil light clearing and releasing heat and the most avoid the method of bitter cold and ice accumulation yin is soft and greasy causing the evil of qi division to retreat and sink inward and instead become pure crimson without moss.\" Ye Tianshi also said: \"It is advisable to clear camp heat first not to get nourishing and greasy for stability. It is advisable to prioritize lightness clarity and uprightness and ensure that the evil forces of the camp are eliminated through the division of qi; Do not immerse yourself in blood that is there is no fear of fainting.",

        "description": "The syndrome of dryness and heat in the heart and stomach is a change in the depth of dryness and heat in the qi and blood. If the dryness and heat in the Yangming Stomach Meridian cannot be completely resolved outside it will inevitably cause blood to flow inside and be superior to the heart. However the dryness and heat in the heart and stomach will burn in the qi and blood syndrome which is the opposite of the pathogenesis. It is commonly seen in febrile diseases heatstroke diseases or seasonal toxins warm toxins and plagues. When it is untreated and mistreated it transforms into heat and dryness. If the internal dryness and heat the spots and external penetration and it can be expected to be resolved by converting from blood to qi it is considered a syndrome. If it is not allowed to penetrate externally it will be deeply embedded in the blood vessels and become internal or latent spots which is a retrograde syndrome and often leads to irreparable consequences. Like the evil of dryness and heat deeply trapped in the blood of the camp steaming and burning within the camp not allowed to reach outside will inevitably penetrate the pericardium block the mind and stand at the risk of being dizzy and closed; When the heat is hot the wind moves and the liver wind is most likely to suddenly move leading to convulsions and convulsions; Evil thrives in internal closure the positive qi does not branch the internal orifices are blocked the positive qi stands detached and when the internal closure and external detachment occur it is difficult to handle them. Therefore it is important to be urgent and clear before burning and ensure that the evil of nourishing blood is transferred out of the Qi component in order to hope for external penetration and release. He Lianchen said \"When using Qingying to penetrate the meridians the detoxification and detoxification of the spots are still not transparent. Often when attacking and expelling the poison the Qi of the mansion becomes clear and the spots begin to penetrate.\" Yu Genchu also said \"For those who pass they cool and detoxify to penetrate the spots; for those who close they directly attack the Sanjiao to expel the poison.",

        "description": "The syndrome of dryness and heat in the heart which is a syndrome of warming heat and transforming dryness is also one of the heart lung diseases and is a bad syndrome of warm heat disease. The new feeling of warmth and heat evil cannot be fully resolved in the Qi fraction and can sink into the human camp. In some cases the upper stem cells can close the heart and if the temperature is too hot the Ying fraction can collapse out of the Qi fraction. Although it is a good omen it can still be caused by the Ying human blood and transmitted back to the heart which is also a bad syndrome. If not treated properly there is a risk of internal closure and external detachment. The syndrome of dryness and heat in the heart is the evil of warming and heat which transforms heat into dryness and cannot be fully resolved through the separation of qi. It is a syndrome of invading the human body and entering the blood. Regardless of whether the new sensation of warmth and heat comes from the Qi Ren camp or the Fu temperature and heat come from the camp the evil of the camp points always passes through the Qi points which is a good omen; If the division of blood cannot be understood it becomes deeply immersed in human blood and becomes a mixture of blood and blood. Even if the division of blood is direct it can burn the blood causing the pathogenesis to be reversed. Although the warm and hot family has not openly spread the word against it the evil is deeply rooted in the disease and ultimately it is not a good situation. The syndrome of dryness and heat in the heart is a syndrome of deep stagnation of dryness and heat in the blood and blood of the camp. Therefore its treatment principle must be to transform the evil of the camp into the flow of qi and divide it into the flow while the flow of human blood is the main flow; It is advisable to clear away the heat of the camp and quickly release the qi. It is not advisable to force one's blood as Zhong Jing once said: \"Once one goes against the sun then against the life cycle \" which means one should not make mistakes again. Ye Tianshi clearly said \"Entering a camp can still heat up and turn into qi and entering blood must cool down and dissipate blood.\" He Lianchen said \"When penetrating a camp to release heat it can still be resolved by turning into qi.\" He Xiushan further said \"It is urgent to clear the camp heat so that the latent heat can be converted into qi and the qi can be released from the guard either from a rash or from excessive sweating",

The lung governs qi the liver governs blood and newly diagnosed diseases are caused by the division of qi in the lung and blood in the liver; The disease of heat stroke caused by excessive temperature is caused by the breakdown of blood in the liver which must be transmitted to the lung and stomach qi for resolution. It is due to the dryness and heat of the liver and lungs which transfers from the blood component to the qi component which is a normal external manifestation and a favorable symptom. If it is not externally transmitted and accumulates blood for a long time it will deeply burn the blood and even consume yin blood ultimately leading to the elimination of burning yin fluid. The disease will worsen and the kidney will turn to lower jiao resulting in a change of yin exhaustion and yang excess which should be considered an adverse syndrome. The syndrome of liver and lung dryness and heat where the blood is divided into dryness and heat must be steamed and burned. Therefore its treatment should mainly focus on clearing and cooling the blood quickly causing the blood to be divided into dryness and heat penetrating and reaching the dryness and heat of the blood and then releasing the qi and resolving it. This is called the method of transferring heat to qi. If the blood is divided into dryness and heat it falls in love with the blood and dissipates and burns the blood it will cause blood stasis and the heat will not reach the outside. Wang Qingren once said \"The plague is within and the blood is burned and refined and the blood will coagulate.\" Therefore Ye Tianshi once said \"Human blood is still afraid of consuming blood and activating it but it must be cooled and dissipated. If the dryness and heat of the blood component deeply sink into the yin component and dissipate the burning of the yin fluid then cooling the blood should be combined with nourishing the yin fluid to support it ensuring that the dryness and heat of the blood component are not transmitted downwards in order to avoid damaging the lower jiao true yin and causing success or failure.",

        "description": "The syndrome of irritable heat in the kidney and stomach is characterized by excessive heat and dryness in the upper and middle regions penetrating into the lower regions of the body. It is characterized by the deep division of qi and yin in the upper and lower regions of the body. The upper and lung fluids the middle and stomach fluids and the lower regions of the kidney yin are all burned by it resulting in a mixture of deficiency and excess. Jing Yue referred to it as \"excess heat in the yang ming region and insufficient yin in the lower regions.\" This means that there is excess heat and dryness in the yang ming region and insufficient kidney water in the lower regions of the yin region. Therefore Wu Kun'an also referred to it as \"yang excess yin exhaustion\" which means excessive heat and dryness in the stomach while the yin fluid in the kidney is. Slightly shallow cases may still be scorched with dry heat in the air and liquid while the pathogenic heat in the stomach may still be hyperactive and the yin fluid in the kidneys may gradually be damaged; The deep ones burn up the yin fluid the stomach heat is still hyperactive and the kidney yin is injured which is what Wu Kun'an said: \"It is the exhaustion of yang hyperactivity and yin and both the stomach juice and kidney fluid are dry.\" Moreover as Wu said \"The body fluid in the stomach is dry and the kidney water in Shaoyin is not branched.\" This leads to a syndrome of yin fluid depletion. If further treatment is inappropriate there is a risk of Yin exhaustion and Yang excess. Therefore the Wu family has a saying that \"if gastric juice is exhausted one must die and if kidney fluid is dried up it cannot be cured\". Kidney stomach dryness heat syndrome is a syndrome of excess dryness heat in the stomach and insufficient yin fluid in the kidney. Therefore its treatment should damage its excess and supplement its deficiency. Gastric dryness and hyperactivity should be mainly focused on clearing away dampness and heat in order to preserve fluid and save yin; If the kidney yin dries up it should mainly nourish the kidney water. As Wu Kun'an once said \"Yin liquid overflows and Yang evil dissolves on its own.\" However when the positive and negative are in decline and evil are flourishing supporting the positive and driving away evil should not be neglected.",

        "description": "The syndrome of lung and kidney deficiency and dryness refers to the deficiency of lung and kidney yin fluid the inability of lung and kidney fluid to self nourish and the dryness originating from the inside. The kidney is a water organ the kidney governs water and the lung is the source above water. When the source of water dries up the water spring will gradually shrink. Therefore the syndrome of lung kidney deficiency and dryness is often caused by a lack of body fluid in the lungs after a heat disease leading to the gradual formation and disappearance of kidney water while the deficiency and dryness of the lungs and kidneys arise internally. Some people also suffer from kidney yin deficiency or even more carelessly drink and turn pale. They do not sleep at night consume kidney yin and cannot contain pure gold. At the same time dragon fire ignites causing damage to lung yin and causing dryness of the lungs and kidneys. The former is caused by external factors and is easy to recover; The latter disease is caused by internal injury with damage to the true element and the most difficult to treat. Like the combination of internal and external evil the root has withered and is most easily exhausted. Wu Kun'an said \"It's due to the exhaustion of true water and water does not make fire.\" Zhou Xuehai said \"The syndrome is the most difficult to solve. The disease is caused by internal injury and it gradually develops. It is caused by dry firewood and intense fire which does not cause self immolation.\" The syndrome of lung and kidney deficiency and dryness starts after an external disease and the disease is still shallow only the change of gas and liquid injuries; If it is deep it will consume the kidney yin and there will be the risk of yin fluid drying up. Especially in the case of deficiency of kidney yin in the body internal movement of the dragon phase and the combination of internal and external pathogenic factors. In case of urgency the true water will dry up while in case of slowness it will fall and damage the door. Therefore the principle of its treatment should always be to use large doses to increase fluid and nourish water in order to save internal combustion.

The disease starts from insufficient stomach yin to nourish the liver leading to the loss of nourishment in the liver and the internal occurrence of liver dryness. It is often seen after prolonged heat disease; Or due to their inherent blood deficiency blood does not nourish the liver resulting in liver dryness which consumes stomach yin and causes stomach dryness commonly seen in internal injuries. The syndrome of liver and stomach deficiency and dryness always results from the deficiency of stomach yin and liver blood which cannot nourish the liver and stomach. Dryness starts from the inside. In mild cases the stomach yin disappears and dries up which hinders the flow of fluids and leads to intestinal dryness and poor transmission; Severe cases include blood deficiency and liver dryness dry wood generates wind wood fire goes up in reverse and the symptoms are constantly changing. The deficiency and dryness syndrome of the liver and stomach is always related to the depletion of yin and blood. Therefore its treatment should mainly nourish the yin and blood of the liver and stomach. If yin and blood are restored internal dryness cannot rise. If the stomach has the power to clear and lower it can lubricate the large intestine to facilitate its transmission; If withered trees are nurtured then the liver will be soft and not rigid the wood fire will remain in place and the liver wind will not rise; Be cautious not to act recklessly to promote diuresis and clear discharge which will further harm gastric juice and consume yin and blood heavily.

        "description": "The syndrome of liver and spleen deficiency and dryness is a syndrome of blood deficiency and dryness and also belongs to the category of middle energizer deficiency and dryness. The spleen regulates blood and the liver stores blood both of which are the main organs of blood. If there is insufficient blood it cannot nourish the liver and spleen causing them to dry up leading to deficiency and dryness. It is commonly seen in people who have lost too much blood or who have been overworked contemplating or depressed excessively accumulating fatigue and depression causing yin and blood damage gradually forming a withered face. The disease belongs to internal injury and treatment is not easy. The syndrome of liver and spleen deficiency and dryness always arises from blood deficiency. Blood deficiency generates internal heat which will consume yin fluid for a long time. Therefore in the beginning internal heat evaporates and burns the blood. If it does not dissolve it consumes yin fluid and yin blood is insufficient. The external cannot nourish the muscles and meridians resulting in muscle weakness. The internal cannot lubricate the large intestine resulting in wind constipation. Even if the liver loses nourishment withered trees generate wind and the wind and yang move inward the symptoms will pile up. The wind and yang will affect the meridians and if it is urgent it can cause spasms and convulsions. If it is slow it will cause damage to the door. The syndrome of liver and spleen deficiency and dryness is caused by insufficient yin blood to moisten the liver and spleen. Therefore its treatment principle is to mainly nourish yin blood with a large dose to moisten its dryness; If yin and blood are full then deficiency and dryness can be resolved internal heat can be eliminated and wind and yang can self extinguish; When the muscles and meridians are nourished they are relaxed while when the gastrointestinal tract is nourished it is transmitted smoothly. Avoid excessive exposure to cold or mistakenly entering the spicy dry and fragrant channels depleting their blood depleting their yin activating their yang aiding their dryness and adding to their transformation.",

        "description": "The syndrome of liver and kidney deficiency and dryness refers to the deficiency of liver and kidney essence and blood which arises from the deficiency and dryness inside and is a syndrome of lower jiao deficiency and dryness. Due to the fact that the liver is responsible for storing blood while the kidney is responsible for storing essence blood depletion is insufficient to nourish the liver leading to liver dryness; If the kidney essence is depleted and fundamentally shaken and the kidney water cannot match yang then the kidney dryness will arise internally. Or after a prolonged illness caused by heat heat damages yin and blood and fire burns yin and withers it; Or if a woman gives birth or has too many children excessive bleeding can cause damage to yin and blood; Or if the essence and blood of the elderly are insufficient and the origin has withered it can lead to the transformation of lower energizer deficiency and dryness. If it is mild it cannot nourish the muscles and meridians causing them to lose their nourishment; Unable to nourish the large intestine internally resulting in poor transmission; If the blood is heavy it will not nourish the liver but the liver will be dry and the kidney water will be sucked down; Or if the yin essence is insufficient to nourish the kidneys and the kidneys are dry and cannot nourish the liver and wood it can cause acute symptoms such as wood withering and wind generating. If the wind and yang move inward there may be spasms and convulsions; Slow down leads to yin withering and internal heat dissipating blood and the appearance of dragons rising internally which poses a risk of fatigue for pedestrians. Therefore the underlying dryness is fundamental and the pathogenesis is profound which is comparable to the upper dryness and the middle dryness. The syndrome of liver and kidney deficiency and dryness is characterized by insufficient essence and blood in the lower jiao of the disease. Therefore its treatment principle is based on nourishing its essence and blood in order to achieve relief. For those with blood deficiency and fluid dryness it is advisable to nourish blood to moisten its dryness; For those who suffer from deficiency of essence and yin depletion it is advisable to nourish and fill in yin essence to aid them. He Lianchen said \"Blood deficiency and fluid dryness are suitable for nourishing blood and moistening dryness.\" Yu Genchu also said \"If the lower energizer is yin deficient then the essence and blood are dry but if the water is strong then the Jing Wei River flows freely. However the deficiency and dryness of the liver and kidney are due to the deficiency of the essence and blood. It is not a single line of grass and trees that can be restored.

        "description": "The syndrome of dryness and dampness in the lung and spleen is characterized by the coexistence of dryness and dampness. Firstly dampness accumulates in the spleen and then the sensation of dryness injures the lungs resulting in the syndrome of dryness and dampness in the lung and spleen. It is commonly seen in summer and autumn dryness which does not occur in the summer months. It is called autumn dryness and autumn dryness and it is also an example of late onset of summer dryness. It may first feel dampness or the dampness of diet which first accumulates in the spleen and then in the lungs. It can also lead to the syndrome of lung dryness and spleen dampness. Dryness is a yang evil while dampness belongs to the yin category. Dryness evil will damage and consume yin fluid while dampness evil often stagnates yang qi. Therefore if dryness is heavy it will dissipate qi and liquid while if dampness is heavy it will stagnate jin qi for a long time and then dampness evil will transform into heat; Exhaustion of dampness will naturally transform dryness so the lung and spleen dampness syndrome will ultimately damage residual qi and fluid. However the coexistence of dryness and dampness is the most difficult to decompose so there are also mixed syndromes of dryness damaging yin fluid and dampness damaging yang qi in the later stage. The syndrome of lung and spleen dryness and dampness is characterized by lung dryness and spleen dampness. Nourishing lung dryness leads to stagnation of spleen dampness dryness benefits spleen dampness and also consumes fluids to aid dryness. Therefore its treatment principle is to moisten dryness moderately without hindering dryness or helping dampness as Yu Genchu once said: \"Xin Runli Lun is suitable for ascending Shang Jiao is suitable and Qi Qi dampness is opened. The method of gently promoting and transforming qi is the most stable when used in the initial stage. For a long time it is important to consider the severity of dryness and dampness as dryness damages the lung fluid. It should be treated with sweetness coolness and refreshing to relieve lung dryness; If one has a damp and depressed temper one should use bitterness bitterness and mild benefit to eliminate spleen dampness.",

The spleen and stomach coexist in the middle energizer but the spleen is moist soil preferring dryness but detesting dampness; The stomach is a dry soil that likes dampness but dislikes dryness; Either external dampness is harmful to people or diet accumulates dampness which accumulates in the spleen resulting in spleen dampness; Either warm heat damages gastric juice or excessive consumption of fragrant dry and spicy food damages gastric yin resulting in a combination of dryness and dampness in the stomach resulting in a syndrome of spleen and stomach dryness and dampness. At the beginning dryness damages the gas and liquid in the stomach dampness stagnates the yang qi in the spleen and leads to a syndrome of deficiency and stagnation. For a long time dampness and depression transform into dryness and the internal dryness and heat eventually dissipate resulting in the dryness of the spleen and stomach. The spleen and stomach dryness and dampness syndrome starts with a mutual victory between dryness and dampness and ultimately leads to the exhaustion of dampness and the transformation into dryness. Therefore from the beginning it is necessary to pay attention to its dryness and dampness clear and nourish the stomach dryness clear and transform spleen dampness and go hand in hand without any contradiction with effective treatment; In the end it is necessary to nourish the air and liquid with great vitality to alleviate its dryness slightly add sweetness and lightness and to promote the rest of dampness with clear priorities in order not to cause any problems.",

Spleen dampness comes from external reception and is a type of excess pathogenic factor; Kidney dryness originates from water deficiency and is a deficiency pathogen. It is a syndrome of external dampness and internal dryness as well as excess dampness and deficiency dryness. Or it may be due to the deficiency of kidney yin water deficiency and fire hyperactivity and the exhaustion of yin leading to dryness; Or warm and deep heat can cause the person to lower the heat depleting the yin fluid of the kidney leading to kidney dryness. And if the spleen dampness is heavy or if the spleen dampness flows down dampness and heat damage yin and the spleen dampness is not already present the kidney dryness will return which can become the spleen kidney dryness syndrome of spleen dampness and kidney dryness. Yu Genchu said \"The syndrome of spleen dampness and kidney dryness is characterized by external and internal injuries. External injuries are mostly caused by incomplete dampness and heat and the yin fluid is injured first. Internal injuries are often caused by alcohol dampness damaging the spleen and lust damaging the kidney. External injuries are already difficult to treat.\" It is a disease in which the dampness evil always stagnates in the qi of the spleen and kidney while dryness evil can be divided into shallow and deep ones. Shallow ones only consume gas and liquid while deep ones will inevitably damage yin fluid and blood. Spleen and kidney dampness syndrome: Spleen dampness should be considered as dryness while kidney dryness should be considered as nourishment. Initially dryness and dampness complement each other with a mixture of deficiency and excess. Therefore nourishing kidney dryness and dryness spleen dampness can be combined simultaneously. If it lasts for a long time it will damage the kidney yin and spleen blood. Therefore it is necessary to nourish yin and nourish blood to alleviate its dryness and also use sweet light penetrating and beneficial methods to eliminate its dampness and stagnation; Always follow the principle of moderate dryness and appropriate tonifying.",

        "description": "The Lung Stomach Wind Fire Syndrome is a fundamental disease of external wind carrying internal fire. It is often caused by the perception of pathogenic factors such as wind temperature wind heat and warm toxin. It contains the lung and stomach to transform fire which is then bound by external wind or is known as stomach heat to transform fire which is a combination of internal and external diseases. It is a syndrome of Qi dividing into wind fire. The occurrence of external depression and internal redness is frequent due to the outbreak of extreme depression. If delayed and untreated although there is no human blood circulation it can also be blinded by the clear yang in the upper part resulting in a dangerous syndrome of spasms and convulsions. Xie Yinglu said \"The syndrome of lung and stomach wind fire is caused by external wind stagnation and the syndrome of external depression and internal redness lasts for many days. At the beginning the stagnation of qi was burning in the upper energizer which is what Wu Kun'an said: \"Evil lies in the emptiness of the upper energizer. If there is no solution to the division of qi and blood there may also be gradual changes in the division of qi and blood resulting in a transformation of the intersection of qi and blood. This is what Xie Shi said: \"Yang Ming blood heat evil from the internal transmission has already spread throughout the three jiao.\" If the treatment is delayed and lost wind and fire carry phlegm blinding the upper jiao blocking the clearing of the orifices there is a risk of spasms and convulsions. As Zhang Zhongjing said: \"Wind warming is a disease and the dramatic appearance is like a sudden seizure. The lung stomach wind fire syndrome is characterized by wind stagnation on the outside fire burning on the inside and stagnation on the upper middle and clear qi. Therefore the principle of its treatment should always be based on clearing and dispersing. Lei Shaoyi said \"Smooth the lungs and clear the stomach.\" Wu Kun'an said \"Qi that is not properly wind-heat can dry in the upper jiao and it should be treated by dispersing evil and clearing heat. It should not be blindly cold and cool.\" \"It must be mainly spicy and scattered and cold and cool should not be suddenly used to suppress evil. As the saying goes \"Evil lies in the emptiness and emptiness of the upper energizer. It is not a medicine that directly reaches the stomach due to bitter cold but can be treated. If the disease cannot be resolved there will be a change of faintness and spasms. Shao Xiangen also said \"The evil is in the upper energizer and the medicine should be light and clear and then taken slowly. Yu Genchu also said \"Avoid sudden use of bitter cold and prohibit waves from using spicy heat. It is advisable to disperse wind evil and clear the hidden fire as Xie Yinglu once said: \"Thoroughly eliminate the evil from both inside and outside making the surface and inside clear and the mind clear. Make the wind still release from the outside heat comes out from below its phlegm is not cured but self eliminates and its wind is not stopped but self stops.",

        "description": "The spleen stomach wind fire syndrome is a combination of external wind and internal fire. It is composed of the spleen and stomach in the central region and is known to accumulate heat to transform fire. Occasionally it is restrained by external wind and erupts due to depression. This is what Ma Yuanyi called \"the syndrome of evil wind fanning outwards solid fire burning inwards and external and internal evil knots\". Xie Yinglu called it \"the true wind fire syndrome where wind rides the fire momentum and fire borrows the wind power\". Its occurrence is also violent so its onset is often urgent severe and dangerous. In light cases it can disturb the clear and empty space of the upper body while in severe cases it can block the meridians and channels preventing smooth passage through the limbs; Even stirring phlegm and fire blocking all orifices. As Xu Lingtai called it \"phlegm and fire are abundant and all the orifices are closed.\" At this time the wind and fire are in full bloom and the normal qi is not supported. Once the internal orifices are closed the vitality is detached and there is a danger of fainting. Therefore in mild cases it can cause headaches and headaches while in severe cases it can cause stroke and syncope. The spleen stomach wind fire syndrome is caused by the external wind triggering the stagnation fire in the middle energizer where the wind is bound externally and the fire originates from the spleen. Therefore its treatment principle is to dissipate wind depression externally dampen the fiery power internally and release both the exterior and interior so that the wind is calm and the fire is calm which can alleviate its urgency; The first priority is to disperse the wind. Zhang Zhongjing said \"Although the fire is weak the internal attack is powerful and the bones and tendons are scorched making it difficult to recover the blood.\" However he still believes that \"the floating pulse should be resolved through sweat And Xie Yinglu also said \"If you want to relieve yourself you must first be troubled. If you are troubled you will be relieved by sweat. How can you know it? If your pulse is floating you will know that sweat will be relieved.\" Xie Yinglu also said \"If you attack your sweat you can reach the limit of evil. The natural wind and fire are calm and flat which is in line with the meaning of the stagnation of fire.\" He also said \"Wind and fire are intertwined and the situation is extremely fierce and urgent. You should use licorice to slow down the fire. He Lianchen also advocated \"dispersing the wind to relieve heat.\" This is a method of relieving bitterness and is indispensable. Therefore Ma Yuanyi advocated \"dividing and dissipating the upper and lower parts treating the surface and inner parts and using warmth to nourish the attack so that the sweat does not harm the past and the lower part does not harm the severe.",

Gallbladder is Shaoyang \"said Wu Kun'an.\" Covering Shaoyang is originally a form of phase fire warming evil and phase fire and using the same qi and phase movements. Shaoyang uses wood fire as its purpose warming evil within and must use Shaoyang as its outlet. \"It is also said that\" covering Shaoyang belongs to wood fire and the meridians in the wind are also affected by qi causing wind induced fire inflammation. Therefore its onset is often acute and severe. Those who carry warmth with the wind will only suppress the clear qi of the upper jiao while those who carry cold with the wind will inevitably suppress the clear yang of the upper jiao; When the external wind dissipates and the internal heat turns to redness it must enter the blood from qi which is a sign of the exchange of qi and blood. The gallbladder stomach wind fire syndrome is a syndrome of external wind heat warming evil accompanied by Shaoyang wood fire and characterized by external stagnation and internal redness. Therefore the principle of its treatment is always to induce wind and heat from the outside and to lower wood fire from the inside as the method. Therefore Wu Kun'an once said \"These are all gallbladder fire that is abundant in the inside and when it goes up through the empty body it is natural not limited to the excess syndrome of typhoid and cold but treated with Shaoyang and fire.

It is a syndrome of internal wind fire or due to external wind heat wind dryness dryness and heat in the human body or due to excessive emotions it excites the liver and gallbladder wood fire and external evil knows to follow the fire to assist the liver yang. The liver yang is hyperactive and the hyperactivity of the liver yang also originates from the fire and the fire is strong enough to generate wind resulting in the syndrome of wind fire. It is also a syndrome of head wind nose and meridians which is caused by the examination of the empty orifices. It is called the syndrome of wind yang and meridians Pu Fuzhou said \"The body's liver and gallbladder are extremely hot and they are also affected by wind evil which cannot be resolved due to stagnation.\" This is based on the hyperactivity of the body's liver yang and gallbladder fire and the external wind dryness transforms into fire. As Yu Genchu once said \"The wind poison has been lingering for a long time and it is often turned into fire.\" Wu Jutong also said \"Dryness transforms into fire.\" Zhang Qianli said \"The dry fire shines on the lungs but gold does not make wood. The liver yang transforms into wind and the upper disturbance clears the air. Therefore although it is called internal cause it is also related to external evil. Its reason is different from that of wind yang which is characterized by hyperactivity and is often related to external evil. Therefore its treatment principle does not lie in suppressing latent energy but should be based on clearing and lowering not on extinguishing the wind but rather on lightly promoting and clearing which is different from the wind yang syndrome. Therefore Yu Genchu once said \"Light and clear propaganda leads to the most achievements\" and Pu Fuzhou also advocated the method of \"clearing the liver and gallbladder dispelling wind and evil\".",

        "description": "The Heart Gallbladder Wind Fire Syndrome is a type of wind fire syndrome where the fire is strong and the wind is strong. The wind is generated from the inside not from the outside. It is mostly driven by the warm and hot qi that is deeply trapped in the blood of the camp carrying the wood fire in the gallbladder. The normal fire and evil fire are intertwined and the fire is strong and the wind is generated. The disease is in the blood of the camp. Therefore it is known as the camp dividing blood and heat and the gallbladder fire is hot and the camp which is what Wu Kun'an said: \"This warm evil is trapped in Shaoyin and it occurs on the surface of Shaoyang.\" It is called Shaoyang Warm Disease and the hand Shaoyin heart is the main blood of the camp which is the same disease as the heart and gallbladder. The Wu family referred to it as' the gallbladder is hot and the camp is divided into heat and the syndrome is not light and insignificant '. The pathogenesis of this disease is mild where the heat source reaches the qi component and is caused by the co burning of qi and blood. In severe cases the heat source sinks into the blood component resulting in two types of heat sources: the heat source and the blood source; If the heat burns for a long time it will inevitably consume the yin fluid of the injured camp resulting in a syndrome of deficiency burning. The syndrome of wind and fire in the heart and gallbladder is a syndrome of the heart camp subduing fire and the wood fire in the gallbladder coexisting. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to clear the camp and cool the blood promote heat and promote fluid production and clear and lower the wood fire as the method in order to relieve the internal burning of the wood fire Wu Kun'an said \"Clearing the heat of the gallbladder and the internal organs as well as relieving the pathogenic factors of the camp and division the heat toxin self resolves.\" Increasing fluid and generating fluid to protect its yin is also important. Wu once said \"Nourishing the water of Shaoyin and the fire of Shaoyang self resolves.\" This is the method of increasing fluid and saving burning. Although it is called wind and fire it cannot be evacuated with wind medicine to consume and aid fire. Therefore Wu said \"Relieving the stagnation of wood and fire avoiding the dissipation of sweat.\" It is also known as \"avoiding wind medicine\" which can only increase fluid and not consume fluid.",

        "description": "The Heart Liver Wind Fire Syndrome is a severe syndrome of wind fire caused by fire. It is caused by the direct entry of heat evil into the heart liver blood system transforming the fire into the internal heat triggering the liver wind. Wind and fire fan each other and dangerous situations emerge repeatedly making treatment extremely difficult. Cheng Xingxuan said \"The evil of warming heat and wind heat deeply affects the blood system either immediately or not and accumulates in the heart and liver often causing spasms and convulsions. Therefore there are diseases such as heatstroke heatstroke wind heatstroke seizures heatstroke convulsions spasms caused by central organs and erysipelas. Warm heat and other heat pathogens directly attack the heart liver and blood components and are in harmony with the fire of the monarch's phase. The evil fire and the normal fire are intertwined and the strong fire generates wind causing internal movement of the liver wind. Fire takes advantage of the wind and the wind helps the fire to be powerful and the wind and fire are intertwined. Therefore the disease often erupts and becomes severe. If it can reach the Qi component on its own its symptoms are slightly mild; If one cannot achieve self realization and falls into the heart the symptoms are severe and treatment is also difficult. Every time the body is closed and the wind moves the wood fire burns and cannot be saved. Therefore Cheng Xingxuan sighed that \"evil has entered the internal organs and it is difficult to expel it\". Heart liver wind fire syndrome is a syndrome of excessive fire generating wind. To treat its wind it is necessary to first treat its fire. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly focus on cooling and clearing blood ensuring the accumulation of the fire of the heart liver blood fraction and quickly converting the Qi fraction to relieve it; If the condition is close to the surface it is advisable to have a slight reference and penetrate it thoroughly so that it can be resolved from the skin ulcers; For those close to the gastrointestinal tract slightly attack and defecate. For those with closed orifices and internal combustion they should follow Wu Jutong's \"method of clearing heat and opening the orifices clearing the camp and benefiting yin cooling the liver and extinguishing the wind.\" Wu Kun'an said \"This evil has already passed through the camp and reached the blood fraction. The heart governs the blood and the evil dries the blood fraction gradually becoming closed internally. The wind medicine dries the blood and the body should be restrained greatly. Even if the bitter cold runs directly through the intestines and stomach it is not suitable for warming the evil to go against the human body. However the disease is at this point and the evil has returned to the internal organs making treatment extremely difficult.",

It is formed by the lung governing the health the heart governing the camp cold stagnation in the lung health and fire burning in the heart camp. The syndrome of the same disease in the heart lung health camp must first have the accumulation of evil fire in the blood camp and then trigger the new cold sensation; It is often caused by the initial exposure to yang evils such as heat and warmth the internal nourishment of blood and the external sensation of new cold which is a disease of latent heat and temperature. Or if the warm heat has already entered the human camp and the lung guard feels a new cold depression and the trapped fire cannot reach the outside and sink in it is a newly sensed warm heat disease. This syndrome can be seen in cases such as pulmonary closure and infantile measles invagination. Heart lung cold fire syndrome is a syndrome of lung Wei Han Yu and heart camp fire concurrent. Mild external cold can only suppress Wei Qi while severe external cold can block Wei Yang; If the fire is mild it will steam and burn the blood while if the fire is heavy it will be hot and burn the blood; If the external cold cannot be resolved the latent fire cannot reach the outside which will cause internal channeling block the mind and even trigger the liver wind resulting in a closed syndrome of wind induced spasms and convulsions. Heart lung cold fire syndrome is a syndrome of external cold stagnation and internal fire candle burning. The external cold cannot be resolved and the internal fire cannot penetrate. Therefore the principle of its treatment should be based on relieving external heat and dispersing cold and external heat should have a path of external penetration; However if the fire is hot inside it will consume the body fluid. If the body fluid is injured the sweat will be passive. If the sweat is strong enough it will exhaust the sweat source even more. To save the sweat source it is necessary to store the body fluid. To store the body fluid it is necessary to quickly relieve the burning of the internal fire. Therefore the treatment principle at this time should be mainly to clear and nourish the blood. If the fire is subdued and reaches the outside the surface cold will open up without the need for a large amount of dispersing Therefore Lei Shaoyi once said \"Those who slightly see the evil wind and cold should not sweat with bitterness nor should they take into account the wind and cold. If the heat inside and the heat outside reach the wind and cold will resolve themselves.\" Just add a slight amount of Xin San powder and slightly open the Wei Fen's cold. Wu Kun'an said on the day \"If you have both headache and cold aversion you can add Qiang Huo to eliminate the evil of the sun and you can self obtain sweat and resolve it. If you use wind medicine to release it the liquid will be dry and hot but instead there will be no sweat and exacerbate it. Therefore in the clear and transparent process you must also use a refreshing and nourishing substance to nourish the source of sweat As Yu Genchu once said \"Make its yin essence overflow and use slight sweating to relieve external symptoms. Make the body fluid flow outwards and sweat slightly to relieve external symptoms.",

Then it only heats up in the yang ming qi of the middle jiao burning the jin qi. If or if delayed and untreated there will be an internal fire inversion and a change of yang deficiency and fiery heat.

The dampness and fire in the stomach the downward movement of the large intestine and the struggle with the dross in the intestines resulting in a dryness syndrome caused by the exhaustion of dampness and fluid injury. The disease is formed by the transformation of dampness and heat into fire and the transformation of dampness and heat into dryness. Therefore it is also common in the middle and late stages of diseases such as dampness and heat heat dampness and dampness and summer heat. The onset of the disease is in the Qi component which cannot be resolved and the dampness and fire sink in. The injured blood can also be converted into the human blood component resulting in a syndrome of Qi and blood intermingling. The gastrointestinal organs are solid and the. However although the dryness has subsided the air and liquid have been injured and the remaining evil remains. There are often symptoms of deficiency and stagnation. If the current situation is lost the evil fire cannot be released either it goes up and becomes a reversal or it is forced down and becomes a catharsis benefit; Even if the deity is shut down internally and the yang qi is shut down externally there will be a change of closed syncope. If the dampness and fire do not go away the positive qi will be injured and the evil will prevail over the positive deficiency. There are also many closed deficiencies and even there is a danger of closed detachment. Gastrointestinal dampness and fire syndrome is a type of dryness and stagnation syndrome caused by dampness and fire in the stomach descending into the intestines and competing with the dross in the intestines. Therefore the treatment principle should always be to clear and lower the dryness in the intestines in order to drive away dampness and fire However Xue Shengbai said \"Due to the sticky dampness and heat it is advisable to slow down the internal accumulation. Unlike the dampness and evil heat in typhoid fever the dry accumulation is solid and the lower accumulation should be steep.\" Ye Tianshi said \"The evil accumulation of typhoid fever is sudden and the lower accumulation should be fierce. Warm diseases often involve dampness and evil internal pulsation and the lower accumulation should be mild. Feces of typhoid fever are loose and the evil accumulation cannot be eliminated. Feces of dampness and warm diseases are loose and the evil accumulation is not completed. The hard stool formula is without dampness and cannot be attacked.\" He Lianchen further said: If a large agent is taken down and left without defense it will inevitably lead to the accumulation of dirt and become ineffective.

By absorbing the evil of warming heat it runs straight through the middle path and accumulates between the original gallbladder and stomach carrying water and grain in the stomach and combining with wood fire in the gallbladder to transform fire into a concurrent syndrome. The stomach is the organ of Yang Ming while the gallbladder belongs to the organ of Shaoyang. Therefore hurting the Han family is also known as the disease of Shaoyang Yang Ming. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is characterized by the accumulation of pathogenic factors between the gallbladder and stomach. If the pathogenic factors originate from the stomach they will stagnate and suppress the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle parts and then burn the qi of the stomach. If it does not resolve it will often move down the large intestine and attach to the dross in the intestine forming a syndrome of visceral excess. If the evil comes from the gallbladder it will suppress the mechanism of turning the pivot and carry the wood fire in the gallbladder to move. Either it will accumulate in the upper part of the gallbladder or it will ignite inside or it will persist in the upper part of the gallbladder. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is characterized by a disease located between the upper and middle parts and between the surface and the inner parts. Therefore its treatment principle should be based on the principle of dredging and clearing away the internal and external heat. Yu Genchu said \"The method should be to relieve the external and internal heat through bitterness and bitterness. And it is said: \"Xin Liang Wei San is used to relieve external heat and external evil is relieved through slight sweating; warming clearing and seeping causing dampness and heat to be relieved through urination.\" If the evil in the stomach is transmitted to the large intestine it attaches to the dross in the intestine and the Yu family once again advocates: \"Bitter and bitter are relieved through defecation and dampness and heat are relieved through defecation Dampness is outside the gastrointestinal tract and heat is inside the gastrointestinal tract. The dampness heat and sliminess of the entrapment of evil energy compete with the dross in the intestines and steam it into a very sticky greasy and foul smelling sauce. It must wait until the entrapment of evil energy reaches five or six times or seven or eight times and then the entrapment of evil energy begins to dissipate. Therefore He Zhenghua also advocated \"broadening the chest and abdomen to slow down\".",

It is caused by dampness and fire in the stomach which invades the liver internally. It triggers the wooden fire in the liver which rushes inward upwards and downwards. It is caused by the interaction of qi and blood evil fire and normal fire and even redness and yin fluid. Warm diseases are called Jueyin Warm Diseases where heat enters Jueyin or malaria of Jueyin or forces blood yin fluid to descend resulting in five color dysentery and silent dysentery. The liver stomach dampness and fire syndrome starts with stomach dampness and liver fire followed by dampness exhaustion and dryness and liver stomach intermingling. Therefore its treatment should always be combined with the stomach to release the liver and the same method as the stomach. It starts with dampness stagnation and the main method is to warm the stomach and dissipate dampness which is to soothe the stomach as Ye Tianshi said; The method of strengthening yang and clearing jue yin calming the stomach and relieving the liver. Wu Kun'an said \"It is advisable to relieve jue yin with a combination of yang and brightness bitter bitter sour cold and hot.

It is also necessary to clear and lower the dryness to harmonize with the stomach as Xu Zhengkui once said: \"The stomach is dry and hot the liver fire is inflamed and the gallbladder and stomach are lost.

It is a syndrome of dampness fire from the lungs to the heart from the qi to the yin from the yin to the blood and from the yin to the blood and from the evil fire to the yin. The syndrome is often acute and dangerous and is often caused by diseases such as dampness temperature summer heat and summer heat. Dampness gradually turns into fire without being released but instead subsides from the yin. Therefore there is a risk of internal closure and external detachment. Heart lung dampness and fire syndrome where dampness and fire are transmitted from the lungs to the heart and from the qi to the human body. Therefore its treatment principle should be urgent and clear so that the evil of qi division can reach the outside and be resolved without sinking into the human camp; If it has already sunk in both Qi and blood can still penetrate heat and transform Qi causing the evil of blood to penetrate and release Qi; Steaming and burning body fluids with damp fire boiling them into phlegm will inevitably be combined with resolving phlegm and promoting resuscitation to prevent internal closure; Evil fire will burn the lung fluid so ginseng should also be used to nourish the fluid to support its evil and prevent its detachment. Therefore He Lianchen said \"There is always a great injury caused by bodily fluids only by saving the Yin that will be extinguished can there be hope.",

        "description": "Heart stomach dampness and fire syndrome also known as lung stomach dampness and fire syndrome is a disease of heart stomach confluence. It is caused by the inability of dampness and fire in the stomach to resolve and the reverse transmission of dampness and fire in the heart. It is also a syndrome of dampness and fire in the stomach which is caused by the division of qi and heat in the stomach and cannot be fully resolved. It can also cause the collapse of dampness and heat in the human blood and in some cases it can be transmitted back to the pericardium. It is often caused by the failure to treat dampness and heat and the misdiagnosis of; This syndrome can also be seen in the case of infantile fetal toxicity turning into fire. Damp fire obstructing the pericardium also known as dampness obstructing can cause internal closure due to the incandescence of the heart. If the yang qi is not sufficient it can also be seen as jue inversion which belongs to the case of deep heat and jue and ultimately belongs to the syndrome of closed jue. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and stomach is caused by the steaming of dampness and heat in the stomach. It first occurs in the Qi fraction and if it is not resolved it gradually enters the blood stream. Wu Kun'an said \"Any heat must carry dampness and dampness is the evil of heavy turbidity. Heat is the Qi of fumigation with heat in the middle of dampness and dampness in the middle and dampness and heat in the middle obstructing the Qi fraction. It should be treated in the Tai Yin of the hand. If it cannot be treated and the evil has no place to vent it gradually enters the Ying fraction and invades the blood stream. At the beginning it is a period of Qi Ying steaming and burning while at the end it is a period of human blood and it is a mixture of Qi and blood or a period of Qi Ying steaming and burning; Even if the heart and mind are closed internally it can lead to a severe syndrome of closed syncope as Wu Jutong once said: \"The heat evil cannot be resolved and deep blood is divided into syncope.\" Eventually it will consume gastric juice and as Ye Tianshi said \"The heat disturbance will consume gastric juice and damage blood vessels.\" The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and stomach is a syndrome of dampness and fire in the stomach where qi enters the camp and blood. Therefore the treatment principle is to urgently clear the Qi and blood or to clear the Qi and blood so that the evil of internal depression can be resolved by converting the Qi and blood from the blood to the Qi. However heat comes from dampness and heat is located in dampness. Therefore it should also be combined with fragrance and light to dissolve the uncleaned dampness and to open the veil of dampness and turbidity which is what Wu Kun'an said: \"It is advisable to release dampness to dissipate heat. If dampness and heat are combined to evaporate body fluid becomes phlegm and phlegm is turbid and obstructed it should also be used to clear phlegm and promote resuscitation; Fire burns the body fluid and it dries up so it should also be used to clear and nourish the body fluid in the stomach. Ye Tianshi once said \"Aroma promotes the elimination of impurities in the orifices regulates it to clear the nutrients and nourish the stomach juice.\" Jin Zijiu also advocated \"The body fluid is known to be consumed by evil moistening dryness and promoting diuresis clearing phlegm and promoting fluid production.",

        "description": "The Xinxi Damp Fire Syndrome is a syndrome of deep dampness and fire in the human body and also belongs to the combination of lung stomach dampness and fire syndrome and heart camp disease. It is a syndrome of dampness and fire reverse transmission which is what Ye Tianshi called: passing through the Wei Ren Camp reverse transmission to the pericardium hence there are heatstroke Ren Camp heatstroke invagination heat stroke blood points heat closure of the heart and dampness and warmth multiplying the pericardium. It is also known as the heart being the hand Shaoyin and the pericardium being the hand Juyin hence it is also known as heatstroke induced Juyin heatstroke induced Jushao and so on. It is often caused by the transformation of heat evil into fire such as heat dampness heat heat and summer heat. If the heat is not treated properly it can lead to the loss of heat and dampness resulting in the wrong treatment of heat and dampness. The so-called \"dampness exhaustion and irritability\" also has this syndrome. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart is characterized by the evil of dampness and fire which cannot be fully resolved in the division of qi. It can sink into the human camp causing both qi and fire to evaporate in the beginning and burning the camp fluid in the long run. If it is not quickly and clear it will inevitably sink deeply into blood and become a syndrome of both qi and blood or camp blood. Dampness is fiery and body fluid condenses into phlegm. Therefore dampness and fire often carry phlegm and turbidity and fire spreads to the pericardium. Phlegm closes the internal orifices leading to internal closure and convulsions. If the evil is abundant and the qi is not supported there will be a change of internal closure and external detachment. The treatment of the syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart camp is always based on clearing the camp and permeating heat causing the evil of the internal camp to sink into the camp and then turning out the qi to dissolve so as not to sink into blood again; It also helps to dissipate phlegm and promote resuscitation in order to prevent convulsions and convulsions. Although fire comes from dampness its clarity should still be combined with the function of relieving dampness. As Wu Kun'an once said \"Heat is caused by dampness and evil so it is advisable to relieve dampness to dissipate heat; relieving dampness and heat and removing dampness will lead to the self release of heat. Ye Tianshi said \"Clearing collaterals and heat must also be accompanied by aromatics to open the internal opening to clear mind and consciousness. If heavy medicine attacks evil it should go straight through the intestines and stomach without interference with the closure of the envelope.",

It always belongs to the transformation of dampness and fire burning in the heart and liver qi and blood and is a concurrent disease of dampness and fire in the lung and stomach qi and dampness and fire in the heart and liver blood. It is often carried by a wooden fire and the hot wind moves. The wooden fire generates wind so it is also known as the heat wind. It is an internal wind rather than an external wind and is different from the heat wind that carries heat in the wind. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and liver or the collapse of the heart and liver blood from the lung and stomach qi or the collapse of the heart and liver blood from the lung and stomach qi are both symptoms of both qi and blood redness. If the evil of the qi component is in the blood it cannot reach the qi component or if the evil of the blood component is in the blood it cannot reach the qi component and if the blood is burned the disease is particularly severe. If the wood fire of the liver is disturbed and interacts with the fire of the heart ruler it will lead to multiple wood fire changes and in the drama the heart and liver will be closed and there is a risk of convulsion. Heart liver dampness fire syndrome is a critical and urgent syndrome characterized by dampness fire burning in the heart liver blood. Therefore the treatment principle is to urgently cool the blood and release the fire to clear it and to ensure that the blood and fire are converted into qi and released. Xue Shengbairi said \"When dampness is exhausted and fire is dissipated human blood flows and desires to be released. Blood or sweat is lost from up and down so it is necessary to cool the blood and release the fire to save yin.\" This is because bleeding is the way out for blood to divide and subdue the fire. Therefore it is not necessary to stop the astringency. If there is an urgent need to clear and release the fire the blood vessels will be at peace. Hua Ban Wai Da is also a way for the blood to accumulate fire and penetrate through the outside. It should follow Wu Kun'an's principle of \"clearing and dispersing blood to penetrate the spots and adding fragrance to dispel impurities to open and close\" which also helps to suppress fire and penetrate through the outside.",

The syndrome of dampness and fire in the heart and kidney is caused by the stagnation of qi dampness and fire which leads to the accumulation of human blood. However if it is transmitted to the heart there will be a phenomenon of qi and blood intermingling. If the division of blood is not resolved it will inevitably lead to a deep division of yin. Heart fire will descend to the kidneys and burn the kidney yin resulting in yin blood intermingling.

It often competes with the dross in the intestines forming a yang ming syndrome hence it is also known as yang ming and heat warming. Steaming with damp heat often leads to yellowing which is a disease of yang yellow. The dampness and heat of the spleen and stomach transform into dampness and fire syndrome often competing with the dross in the intestines to form a steaming trend. He Lianchen said \"Sticky dampness and heat compete with tangible dross\" gradually becoming the syndrome of \"dampness and heat have already dissipated and heat accumulation exists alone\" as Wu Jutong once said. Even when it is caused by anger and blood and the transaction is hot dampness and fire syndrome is more dangerous than dampness and heat. Wu Kun'an once said \"Evil heat is transmitted from Yangming to Taiyin and the deeper the heat the more severe the poison\". It may carry phlegm and ascend to the clear orifices confuse the divine mechanism block the internal orifices and become a closed syndrome. However if the circulation is too low it can also damage the spleen and stomach qi and fluid. Every time there is too much it can cause detachment. Xie Yinglu said \"If the external pressure is too high it can damage the spleen and stomach causing the middle soil to become tired causing the body fluid to sink and not rise. Otherwise the middle soil will become completely hopeless.\" In the spleen and stomach dampness fire syndrome dampness suppresses the fierceness and the treatment should be urgent to release dampness and release fire to subdue its potential. Ye Tianshi said \"The three jiao are obstructed the turbid qi is diffuse the pungent fragrance drives away the impurities and the appropriate circulation is a certain method.\" However when the spleen and stomach are filled with fire they will fake the large intestine as the way out Wang Tingzhen once said \"Dampness and heat in the stomach and internal organs can only be discussed. Although the cloud transforms heat it is mainly due to dampness that the diagnosis of warm diseases is necessary. When yellow dryness is seen it can be discussed. When yellow dryness is seen it can still be used to expel it from the stomach or bitter warmth can be used to help alleviate dryness. When yellow is seen it can be used to relieve bitterness. When yellow and white are combined or gray and white it can still be used to lift it to reach the lungs and it cannot be mistaken There are many Yangming syndromes but few Taiyin syndromes and the ruler still uses bitterness to lower the Xin Tong supplemented by the Xin Dan. \"He Lianchen also said \" Sticky and damp heat fighting with tangible dregs also advocate for slowing down and moving grinding and swinging. \"He also said \" If a severe agent is used to attack and move without keeping it it will inevitably lead to the accumulation of dirt and not being able to do so. Instead it will cause dilute water to damage the normal qi and become a bad symptom. \"There are differences between the treatment of spleen and stomach dampness and fire and the treatment of gastrointestinal dampness and fire.",

        "description": "Lung and stomach dryness and fire syndrome is a syndrome of upper and middle jiao qi and dryness and fire. It is mostly absorbed by yang pathogens such as wind heat warmth and heat from the mouth and nose and internally transmitted to the lung and stomach qi. It has not been resolved for a long time consuming lung and stomach fluids leading to the transformation of dryness and fire. It can be seen in the middle stage of new sensation and warm heat and can also be seen in the period of qi accumulation and heat heat exhaustion. The disease is still shallow and if treated properly there are still few changes in symptoms. If delayed and untreated it is also inevitable to collapse causing people to engage in human blood and reverse the transformation of the heart. The syndrome of lung and stomach dryness and fire is characterized by the accumulation of dryness and fire in the upper middle and two jiao. Its pathogenesis is mild with upper disturbance of qi and severe with steaming and burning of body fluids. If there is no clear solution every time there is a danger of both qi and blood burning; If you have been in love for a long time and cannot understand it you will inevitably damage the residual qi and liquid which is a sign of righteousness deficiency and evil. If there is a mistake there will be a phenomenon of excessive evil and internal closure a lack of proper qi and a change of syncope and detachment. Lung and stomach dryness fire syndrome where the dryness fire is burning and consumes the lung fluid and stomach fluid. Therefore its treatment principle is always to be bitter sweet cool and moist clear and clear the lungs and stomach. It can even be used to reduce bitterness and clear the lower body causing the dry fire to descend in order to preserve the body fluid and there is no worry of internal depression when the body fluid is stored. For those who have not yet established their evil spirit it should be primarily clear. As He Lianchen once said \"When the evil energy of Shangjiao is activated the weather decreases and the earth's qi naturally moves with it.\" Therefore clearing can also be used for clearing and venting. Clear it without going away and then combine it with bitterness or saltiness to clear it; If it is already strong it is advisable to descend urgently. After descending it is not necessary to clear it before proceeding.",

        "description": "Gastrointestinal dryness and fire syndrome is a syndrome of heat accumulation in the intestines and stomach which transforms dryness into fire. It is commonly known as yang ming fu syndrome. The pathogenic heat of the six exogenous factors is transmitted to the gastrointestinal tract competing with the dross in the intestines dissipating and burning intestinal fluids and transforming dryness into fire. Internal injuries can transform from food to heat and can also transform from dryness to fire. The transmission of evil through the gastrointestinal tract is in accordance with the pathogenesis of the disease. The ancients said: \"Yang Ming has no recurrence\" which means that evil can be transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract and can be discharged along the intestine without any further transmission. However if the treatment is not appropriate it can be said that the patient should lose the lower part or if the lower part is not properly treated the symptoms may also be complicated and there are many dangerous and serious symptoms such as spasms syncope closure and detachment which can all occur. Gastrointestinal dryness and fire syndrome also known as the syndrome of Yang Ming visceral excess in the Han family is caused by the stomach entering the intestines competing with the dross in the intestines burning the body fluid in the intestines and transforming dryness into fire. Zhang Zhongjing said \"This body fluid is dead the stomach is dry and it belongs to Yangming.\" He also said \"Those who do not change their clothes have solid inside and have difficulty defecating are called Yangming. Therefore it is called \"there are dry arrows in the stomach\". However Yu Genchu once said \"Wherever the pathogenic factors of typhoid fever are transmitted to the body and the heat of warm heat diseases accumulates in the body they all belong to the Yang Ming viscera syndrome \" which is a syndrome of both typhoid fever and warm diseases. There is also a syndrome where heat accumulates in the diet due to internal injuries enters the intestine from the stomach and transforms dryness into fire. Although the condition is slightly delayed its pathogenesis is different. Although the family of miscellaneous diseases does not directly state their Yangming visceral syndrome Zhongjing once said \"Therefore those who are naturally have their own accommodation and food. Therefore the Yangming viscera syndrome must be accompanied by the accumulation of heat in the stomach. Gastrointestinal dryness and fire syndrome in terms of its pathogenesis is characterized by mild and mild pathogenic factors but it ignites in the upper energizer disturbs the clearing of qi and is caused by its burning nature. It is commonly seen in diseases of internal injury and heat accumulation in the diet. Those with severe pathogenic factors and acute symptoms are often symptoms of external infection caused by seasonal diseases. Among them there are also shallow and deep divisions: those with shallow pathogenesis but they burn at the Yang Ming Qi division initially burning the Jin Qi and later consuming the gas and liquid; Those with a deeper pathogenesis have a deeper Yang Ming blood fraction which is a syndrome of Qi and blood intermingling. If one remains trapped for a long time they may become deeply trapped in the Yin system either due to Qi Yin or Yin blood leading to the depletion of the injured Yin fluid. However the changes in symptoms are often caused by the lack of treatment and mistreatment: either the current situation is lost or the situation is not handled properly resulting in a delay in timing. The evil fire is fiery the body fluid dissipates day by day the vitality is depleted day by day the evil substance is positive and weak and the evil substance can turn closed to syncope and the positive deficiency can cause detachment. Therefore delaying treatment and mistreatment will inevitably lead to spasms syncope closure and detachment. Therefore Zhongjing has a saying of \"one reverse still leads to the sun and another reverse promotes the life cycle\". It ",

Diseases often result from overeating spicy and spicy foods as well as the thick taste of sorghum leading to heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach; Or even more susceptible to the heat of external evil winds competing with them consuming body fluids and gradually causing dryness to turn into fire. If it is a disease it may cause or disturb the empty orifices and there may be diseases such as toothache and aphthous ulcers; In the case of moderate digestion of gastric juice there are symptoms of moderate digestion and noise; If the meridians are obstructed horizontally there may be symptoms such as central organs and wind prickly heat which are mostly miscellaneous diseases. The spleen and stomach dryness and fire syndrome is caused by the accumulation of heat in the middle energizer or by external wind heat in the body transforming dryness into fire. Therefore the principle of its treatment is to clear and clear the accumulated heat in order to determine its stagnation and then the dry fire can be eliminated. Therefore Liu Hejian said \"Its treatment is to clear and make the qi weak the yang weak and the earth level and heal.\" Shen Jinao also advocated the method of \"guiding it\".

        "description": "The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach refers to the syndrome of dryness and heat in the stomach which carries wood fire in the gallbladder and is accompanied by dryness and fire. Therefore the ancients referred to it as the Shaoyang Fu Syndrome or Shaoyang Yang Ming with two Yang diseases in combination; Evil fire and normal fire are intertwined and gallbladder fire and stomach fire are intertwined. Both the gallbladder and stomach are internal organs so they are called Shaoyang Fu syndrome which is different from gastrointestinal dryness fire syndrome and Yangming Fu syndrome. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is a combination of dampness and fire in the stomach and wood in the gallbladder. If it is triggered by stomach fire and wood fire the pathogenesis tends to be Yang Ming (stomach) which is a disease of clearing qi in the upper and middle regions. It originates from the evil of Shaoyang and is passed down to Yangming. When gallbladder fire and stomach fire are combined the pathogenesis tends to be biased towards Shaoyang (gallbladder) which is a sign of unfavorable rotation of the Shaoyang pivot. The syndrome of dampness and fire in the gallbladder and stomach is characterized by the return of pathogenic factors from the gallbladder to the stomach and intestines which can lead to a false stomach and intestines as the outlet. The pathogenesis of the disease is also a direct transmission so it is not difficult to clear and solve the problem in one fell swoop Zhang Zhongjing once said \"Shaoyang should not sweat. Sweating leads to delirium which belongs to the stomach. If the stomach is harmonious it will heal; if the stomach is disharmonious it will become restless and palpitate However if the current situation is not resolved or if the law is not followed the evil will also change in the gallbladder and internal organs. Its treatment should be based on the principle of dredging and benefiting while also clearing the lower organs. This is the so-called method of reconciliation and clearing and reconciliation and clearing both the lower organs. If you want to quickly eliminate the dryness of the gallbladder and stomach you must use clearing and promoting the lower organs as the law. If the disease is related to the central clearing of qi it is necessary to dredge and benefit its pivot. It is the method of dredging and benefiting the central organs clearing the lower gallbladder and stomach which is not easy.",

        "description": "The Heart Stomach Dry Fire Syndrome is a syndrome in which the dry fire in the stomach sinks into the Qi and nourishes the blood. It is caused by Yang Ming's warm heat not being able to penetrate from the Qi and nourish the blood and the pericardium is dried up resulting in a severe syndrome of Qi and blood intermingling. It is not suitable for adjustment or delayed treatment and can also lead to changes in spasms syncope closure and detachment. It can also feel warm heat and the mild evil cannot occur immediately. It accumulates in the blood and is triggered by the heat of the stomach's diet transforming dryness into fire Therefore pathologists also refer to it as the syndrome of Yangming Ying Fen. The pathogenesis of the syndrome of dryness and fire in the heart and stomach is the transformation of qi and blood circulation. The syndrome of Qi and Yin burning together is often caused by the error of the new sensation of heat and heat resulting in the rapid change of Qi and Yin and the multiple and urgent symptoms; Those who have a deep accumulation of qi and blood are less prone to outbreaks and are susceptible to mild pathogenic factors. Therefore they cannot immediately become ill and must be triggered by external factors. Therefore their onset is relatively mild but it is difficult to quickly eliminate. However there are also those who engage in human blood and their changes are also urgent and severe so it should be discussed separately. The syndrome of dry heat in the heart and stomach refers to the transmission of stomach heat to the heart and the dry heat is driven by qi and blood. Therefore its treatment principle is to clear the dry fire of qi and blood while mainly clearing and relieving the stomach fire of Yangming using spicy cool sweet and cold heavy agents to urgently clear the dry fire of Yangming in order to save the body fluid of Yangming; Even if it is bitter and salty it is not taboo in the Dharma; As the saying goes it is better to stop boiling with boiling water than to make a drastic decision. Therefore it is also advisable to urgently withdraw the heat from the Yang Ming's internal organs; As soon as the fire of qi is scattered the fire of nourishing blood can reach the outside world. The treatment of heart and stomach dryness lies in the principle of Yangming.",

There are internal and external reasons for it and external reasons are caused by external sensations of warmth and heat evil especially heat evil. The ancients said \"Heat is joyful and sad \" and fire is transformed by warmth and heat. The evil fire originates from the blood of the host and is often accompanied by the burning of blood which can be seen in warm and hot diseases. The internal cause is often caused by excessive exertion or contemplation or depression which excites the monarch's appearance. The fire originates from the internal and is often accompanied by the symptoms of wood fire burning qi and blood and is often seen in miscellaneous diseases. The syndrome of dryness and fire in the heart and liver was referred to as the syndrome of wood and fire in ancient times. Both the heart and liver organs are controlled by the blood but the two are interrelated and their onset must involve the blood. Those who lean towards the heart tend to focus on the heart which is often caused by the same disease as the blood and are often due to external factors caused by the blood of the host. The pathogenesis of the disease is reversed resulting in multiple critical symptoms; Those who lean towards the liver are often caused by internal injuries such as liver gallbladder wood and fire. The disease is mildly mild but it is related to emotions and cannot be easily treated; Or external evil can trigger wood fire and the disease is often urgent and severe but it is easier to regulate and treat. Heart liver dryness and fire syndrome its pathogenesis is not external blood heat internal burning and wood fire internal burning. Therefore the principle of its treatment is to clear the heart and cool blood and to clear and reduce wood fire. Therefore He Lianchen said \"When clearing the heart and penetrating the collaterals purging the liver and suppressing the wind. He also said \"The wind medicine dries blood and is suitable for great prohibition. Even if the bitter taste sinks cold it does not go straight through the intestines and stomach. It dissipates the bitterness and warmth and only robs the stomach juice it should be a great prohibition. The syndrome of fiery blood division has been regarded as a bad disease since ancient times. Although Ye Tianshi advocated for \"clearing and dispersing blood division using mild drugs to penetrate spots and using fragrance to remove impurities to open internal orifices.",

Evil fire affects the heart and kidneys with the heart governing blood and the kidneys governing true yin. When the fire shines on the heart and kidneys the yin blood is depleted resulting in a syndrome of water deficiency and fire hyperactivity. The ancients called it: the true yin is exhausted and the strong fire reignites. Or it may be caused by external heat and heat internal depression of the heart and kidney or external wind and cold internal accumulation of yin stagnation and heat and severe heat that can damage and consume yin and blood or even more due to the deficiency of yin and excessive fire in the human body the combination of internal and external evil and the transformation of dryness and fire. It is a disease biased towards the heart resulting in a syndrome of excessive blood and heat and biased towards the kidney resulting in yin injury and fiery heat. Due to its damage to the yin and blood of the heart and kidneys the king fire that excites the heart the fire of the dragon phase in the kidneys the intersection of evil fire and normal fire the yin injury leads to excessive fire and excessive fire leads to the exhaustion of yin thus leading to multiple dangerous malignant transformation syndromes. He Lianchen said \"From the intersection of lust and subdued fire I am afraid that in an instant Yin will run out. Yu Genchu once said \"In an instant if yin is exhausted one will die.

Yu Genchu also said \"Avoid recklessness and publication. It is urgent to clear the interior and save yin and to quickly purge the heat of mutual steaming to store yin fluid.

It is often caused by the sensation of warm heat dryness heat and external evil in the body delaying treatment and transforming fire to damage yin and consume fluid. It is also known as yin deficiency and excessive fire. However it is different from the cause of deficiency fire which leads to fire due to deficiency. Compared to those who are not caused by deficiency when the evil fire is ignited internally and the lung and kidney yin fluids are injured day by day if not treated properly the source of the evil fire will have the potential to be extinguished and the yin fluids will be at risk of becoming chronic. The syndrome of lung and kidney dryness and fire is characterized by the coexistence of fire and yin deficiency in the lung and kidney yin fluids. The pathogenesis is characterized by the coexistence of fire and yin deficiency with shallow cases dissipating and burning yin fluids deep cases dissipating and drying up true yin. The kidneys store the true water of the sky and the lungs are the source of water above the water. The dryness and fire dissipate and burn the lung and kidney and the lower part of the kidney water and the upper part exhausts and dissipates the source. If the treatment is not appropriate there is a tendency for the source to be extinguished and the true yin is at risk of being dried up; The Yin fluid will be exhausted and the Yang fire will be solely hyperactive. Yin will not benefit Yang and there is also a concern of sudden withdrawal of Jue Yang. Lung and kidney dryness and fire syndrome where both fire and yin wither together. To save yin one must first eliminate its fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to clear the lungs and kidneys clear fire and nourish dryness in order to save the yin fluid of the lungs and kidneys. Wu Jutong said \"Those who want to relieve dryness should first nourish their dryness. They cannot simply use bitter cold as taking it can lead to extreme dryness.\" One method should be to combine sweetness and bitterness to transform Yin Qi. In addition clearing the source and purifying the flow is also a great method for treating lung and kidney dryness and fire. He Lianchen said \"When clearing the lungs the lungs are the source of water above and when the lungs are clear the water is clear.\" For those with deep diseases there is also a method of nourishing the kidney and transforming the source by infusing water above that is Sun Langchuan said \"Invigorating the kidney and infusing water above nourishing and transforming the source to increase body fluid.

        "description": "The liver lung dryness fire syndrome is a syndrome of qi and blood intermingling which is caused by the fire of the lung meridian qi and the intermingling of the fire of the liver meridian blood. It must be caused by the fact that the person already has liver fire and feels warm and hot qi attacking the lungs or when cold is trapped in the lungs and prolonged depression is also caused by the fire triggering liver fire and combining to form a disease; The liver fire goes against it and helps the evil fire to burn the lung's gold so it is known as wood fire attacking the lung and wood fire punishing the gold. The syndrome of liver and lung dryness and fire in which the lung governs qi and the liver governs blood is always characterized by the intermingling of liver and lung qi and blood or the activation of liver fire by lung fire. It is a syndrome of qi and blood often accompanied by external pathogenic factors or liver fire ascending against the lungs. It is a syndrome of blood and qi and is often caused by internal liver qi diseases; If caused by external pathogens the disease is often urgent and severe but treatment is appropriate and not difficult to quickly resolve; The disease caused by liver qi itself is often caused by wood fire and its symptoms are often urgent and severe and it is difficult to quickly resolve. If there is a delay it will eventually become the root of strain. The syndrome of liver and lung dryness and fire always belongs to the syndrome of wood fire invading the lungs and the intersection of qi and blood. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to calm its wood fire clear both qi and blood purge the liver and clear the lungs which is its major method. Fei Boxiong said \"Liver fire accumulates and suddenly invades the lung acupoints causing inflammation and forcing blood to rise.\" Therefore Yu Genchu advocated for \"purging fire and clearing gold to protect the lungs \" mainly to purge the liver so that wood fire does not invade the lungs. However clearing the lung can also calm the liver and the so-called clearing gold can alleviate wood. Clearing the liver and clearing the lung is not contradictory and ultimately it is necessary to nourish yin and soften the liver to promote the afterlife. Therefore Ma Peizhi advocated for \"Gan Han Jie Re and Yin\" and Yu Genchu also advocated for \"nourishing body fluids to improve the afterlife",

The syndrome of stagnation in the lung and stomach and transforming fire is the fundamental disease of upper and middle stagnation and fire. The disease is mainly caused by the lung and stomach and is referred to as the Sun Yang Ming Syndrome or Yangming Disease or Warm Epidemic. Warm heat stagnates the lungs and stomach and there is also this syndrome of not venting. Stagnation cannot be resolved and the internal fire turns to blazing which can also become a state of incandescence. The blood and hair spots of people with depression and fire are called yang toxins; Sinking of the human intestine can turn into dysentery with some cases of external closure and internal detachment. The syndrome of lung and stomach stagnation and fire refers to the stagnation of external pathogenic factors in the lung and stomach the stagnation of stomach yang for a long time leading to the transformation of fire the initial stagnation of qi in the upper energizer and the clearing of qi the loss of external and internal qi in the circulation and the inability to vent the stagnation of fire. The Buddha is stagnant inside and outside; Even if it carries the qi of the lungs and stomach upwards the qi mechanism may rise but not fall. If there is a slight delay the gloomy fire will turn from fiery to vigorous and the qi will force blood. In the drama the gloomy fire will rush up and down and there is also a risk of internal closure and external detachment. The syndrome of lung and stomach stagnation and fire is always a syndrome of external evil invagination and qi stagnation and fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be based on the principle of promoting depression and releasing fire with the method of promoting the stagnation of the upper jiao qi and clearing the lung and stomach to suppress fire. This is what ancient people called: evil is in the chest and diaphragm and it is advisable to open it to promote it in order to release heat evil between the chest and diaphragm; If Qi stagnation cannot be opened then the fire will not fall. Therefore Xie Yinglu said \"Attack its sweat and evil can be fully reached. The natural wind is calm and the fire is flat which is in line with the meaning of the stagnation of fire",

The syndrome of spleen and stomach stagnation of fire where the spleen and stomach are located in Zhongzhou is the center of the three jiao. Therefore the stagnation of fire in the middle jiao will inevitably affect the three jiao.

The stomach heat is superior causing it to invade the envelope and even blinding the heart and mind. Therefore Zhang Zhongjing said \"If it goes down the stomach becomes empty and the qi moves the diaphragm. Yu Genchu once said \"The Qi of the heat of the guest is multiplied by deficiency and sinks between the heart and stomach meridians.\" The heat evil invades the heart and chest and cannot spread over and the fire occupies the pericardium. \"This is the stuffy syndrome of the stagnation of heat in the meridians.\" The pathogenesis of the heart and stomach stagnation of fire syndrome is always due to the stagnation of heat in the heart and stomach meridians and the disease is in the upper jiao.

The disease is caused by depression in the liver and gallbladder which leads to a lack of vitality in the liver a failure in the rotation of the gallbladder and internal organs and the inability to release the internal stagnation of wood fire. Alternatively it is caused by the transformation of external evil into heat which accumulates in the liver and gallbladder and the stagnation and fire are transformed by prolonged stagnation. As Yu Genchu once said \"Evil heat is transmitted to the Jueyin meridian syndrome and this yang meridian heat is also transmitted to the foot yin meridian standard disease. Alternatively due to the usual preference for greasy substances and the pungent roasted taste internal heat accumulates in the liver and gallbladder which can also lead to internal stagnation of wood fire and become a syndrome of liver and gallbladder stagnation of fire. The pathogenesis of liver and gallbladder stagnation and fire syndrome is always due to the stagnation of qi in the liver and gallbladder and the inability to release wood fire. However stagnation and fire are the main pathological changes ranging from mild external stagnation and internal steaming to severe external stagnation and internal burning. Initially the burning vapor is divided and for a long time it will inevitably change from qi to blood resulting in the exchange of qi and blood. The liver and gallbladder stagnation and fire syndrome whether caused by external factors internal factors or a combination of internal and external pathogenic factors is mainly characterized by qi stagnation and fire. Therefore its treatment principle should be based on the principle of soothing the liver and gallbladder and also on the method of clearing and reducing wood fire.

Therefore it is often characterized by deficiency of qi and deficiency of qi. Jue Yin Disease in \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases\" refers to the syndrome of advancing and retreating of jue heat which was called by ancient people: stagnation of fire to clear the path suppression of yang qi in the spleen and soil and inability to pass out and the reversal of fire and hydration hence it is also known as fire stagnation; After illness there is a recovery of fatigue and overeating which can also cause damage to the spleen and soil resulting in the stagnation of qi and the recovery of heat due to fire stagnation. The pathogenesis of liver and spleen stagnation and fire syndrome is always from liver stagnation to transforming fire into the spleen leading to the transformation of liver excess and spleen deficiency. In mild cases it is the deficiency of qi deficiency and fire steaming and in some cases it may be due to Buddha stagnation outside sinking into the human intestine or ascending against the stomach; Dramatists may damage the stomach meridians or block yang qi internally leading to changes such as blood overflow and syncope closure. The liver and spleen stagnation of fire syndrome is a transformation of external stagnation and internal fire. Therefore its treatment should be to relieve the stagnation of the liver and spleen and clear and lower the fire of the liver and spleen; However the main pathogenesis of this disease is liver hyperactivity and spleen deficiency. Therefore suppressing the liver and supporting the spleen is also the main principle that is to clear and disperse the stagnant fire of the liver it must also benefit the qi and regulate the spleen. Although it is said to balance deficiency and excess it must be mainly focused on clearing and releasing the stagnant fire.",

The syndrome of deficiency fire is always caused by the deficiency of lung qi and heart fluid the lack of fluid in the heart and the self prosperity of heart fire. Heart fire multiplies the lungs and consumes lung fluid causing dryness and heat in the lungs. Yu Genchu said \"The deficiency of vital energy leads to the inability to absorb yin fire. Therefore it is also known as yin fire. The pathogenesis of heart-lung deficiency fire syndrome is always due to insufficient lung qi and heart fluid in order to nourish the heart fire and cause internal movement of the monarch's fire resulting in failure of the heart and mind. Over time it can also affect the heart yang. Even the internal fire of deficiency is blazing and the yin and yang qi do not match resulting in sudden fainting.

        "description": "Heart liver deficiency fire syndrome is a syndrome of insufficient yin and blood leading to the movement of fire. It is caused by insufficient yin and blood in the heart and liver and the lack of coordination between the fire of the heart and the fire of the liver leading to internal movement resulting in the syndrome of deficiency fire. It is common to see severe illness and prolonged illness or loss of blood due to new childbirth or excessive effort and consideration resulting in a dark consumption of heart and liver yin blood. Heart liver deficiency fire syndrome is originally a body with insufficient yin and blood. Yin does not replenish yang and the heart and liver do not have yin and blood to nourish. Therefore the internal movement of the fire in the monarch's phase may be due to restlessness of the mind or the monarch's phase. If the external evil is more oppressed and the internal evil is trapped or if the external evil is concealed and the internal fire is transformed the evil fire is accompanied by the normal fire and turns into a strong fire. The weak fire is accompanied by the solid fire which can cause the wood fire to evaporate and become weak and even consume the yin liquid. Eventually the yin withers and the fire becomes hot and in severe cases the wood fire self immolates causing the yin to exhaust and the yang to jue. Therefore Ye Tianshi once said \"The deep heat robs the Yin and leads to convulsion.\" Yu Tinghong also said \"The heat cannot be released and the Yin fluid will flash and die. Heart liver deficiency fire syndrome where the disease is caused by insufficient yin and blood to aid the fire of the monarch's phase and moves internally. If it carries evil fire and moves then the lack of fire becomes strong fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always focus on nourishing yin and also on clearing and lowering; If you move with external fire it is better to clear and release the evil fire of yin. If the heat cannot be released it will lead to yin exhaustion and death.",

        "description": "Spleen and stomach deficiency fire syndrome is a syndrome where the spleen is not strong enough to lift and the stomach yang is depressed leading to the transformation of fire. Due to the deficiency of vital energy it is also known as yin fire. As Li Dongyuan said \"If one's diet is improper and the cold and warm are uncomfortable the spleen and stomach are damaged; joy anger worry and fear consume vital energy. This not only leads to the decline of vital energy in the spleen and stomach but also leads to a strong heart fire. If one's heart fire is also yin fire\" (\"Spleen and Stomach Theory\"). However the so-called \"heart fire\" in Dongyuan should be stomach fire. Not only does Dongyuan have the saying that \"stomach diseases result in short breath and less energy leading to great heat\" but the \"Neijing\" has also mentioned that \"some people are tired their body qi is weakened their valley qi is not abundant their upper jiao is not effective their lower abdomen is blocked their stomach qi is hot and their hot qi is smoked in their chest so they are called internal heat\". From this it can be seen that due to the deficiency of the form qi and the deficiency of the valley qi the upper jiao cannot function and the lower wan cannot function. The qi of the clear yang is stagnant in the stomach and the stomach yang generates heat and transforms fire Therefore in the case of spleen and stomach deficiency fire syndrome the pathogenesis is always due to the weakness of the spleen and the transformation of stomach yang into fire. The spleen is the wet soil and the stomach is the dry soil so the beginning is the mutual victory of dryness and dampness. The spleen and stomach are at odds and if they do not rise they will inevitably cause the clear qi to not rise and even sink. If they do not recover over time the spleen yang will also decline and the deficiency yang will lose its convergence and float upwards. Therefore in the Eastern Wall there is a saying that \"the beginning is the heat center\" and \"the end is the cold center\" The saying is: Spleen and stomach deficiency fire syndrome the fire is caused by insufficient spleen qi the clear yang qi is lost in the ascending movement and the stagnation in the stomach generates heat and transforms into fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to replenish the spleen and elevate the clear yang. Qingqi rises turbid yin decreases stomach yang is not depressed and its fire self converges. Therefore bitter cold is prohibited but sweet and warm are used. This is the method of \"sweet and warm removing great heat\" in Dongyuan. When observing the Eastern Wall: \"Use sweet and warm herbs to replenish it and elevate its yang while sweet and cold herbs to purge its fire will heal. The method of \"avoiding bitter and cold medicine to relieve stomach soil\".",

It is one of the primary diseases of deficiency fire where the yin blood dries up and cannot nourish the liver wood. Fire starts from the inside and is often caused by prolonged illness caused by heat. Evil fire is deeply trapped in the yin blood causing the yin blood to dry up and the liver and gallbladder to lose nourishment causing wood fire to move inside. Zhang Yuqing called it a syndrome of \"burning wood fire inside due to yin deficiency\". The pathogenesis of liver and gallbladder deficiency fire syndrome always changes from insufficient yin and blood to internal movement of wood fire. Or due to deficiency causing fire it still belongs to normal internal movement and the condition is slightly mild; If the external heat sensation warms the heat and the internal yin blood transforms into fire then the evil fire and the normal fire are intertwined and the disease is more severe. Mild cases are characterized by symptoms of deficiency and steaming while severe cases are characterized by symptoms of deficiency and burning. If left untreated for a long time it will inevitably damage yin and blood resulting in a disease of deficiency with more evil and less evil. Liver and gallbladder deficiency fire syndrome yin and blood have been injured and internal movement of wood fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be based on nourishing yin and blood using the method of clearing and reducing wood fire and Zhang Yuqing's method of \"harmonizing yin and ginseng with acid and bitter discharge\". If the external evil falls into the yin branch and the evil fire intersects with the normal fire it is more important to refer to the clear and transparent method as advocated by Yu Genchu: \"Clear and clear the yin branch and heat stagnation so as to release the yang branch. In short the yin blood has dried up and the empty fire is blazing inside. Sincerity fears that the right and evil will prevail and the yin will be exhausted and die. Therefore Ma Yuanyi said \"If we do not first aid the Yin that has fallen then the big deal will be over.",

Due to the deficiency of Yin and blood it is not enough to nourish the liver and wood and the wood withers and ignites fire; After heat disease yin injury and blood loss liver and wood loss of nourishment can also cause internal movement of deficiency fire; The wood fire is contrary to the stomach which will dissipate and flush the gastric juice. The stomach fire also arises from this resulting in the syndrome of liver and stomach deficiency fire. The liver stomach deficiency fire syndrome is always characterized by yin deficiency and liver fire multiplying the stomach hence it is called yin deficiency and liver dryness yin deficiency and liver transverse jueyang invading the stomach and disharmony between the liver and stomach. The initial onset of the disease is due to both qi and yin injuries. When the wood fire reverses it can cause damage to yin and blood over time. The liver is the main reservoir of blood and if the deficiency fire persists for a long time it will consume and damage the blood; Even if it damages the blood vessels it forces blood to act recklessly; If there is too much blood overflow the qi will detach with the blood and there will be a change in the loss of qi and blood. The liver stomach deficiency fire syndrome starts from yin deficiency loses nourishment due to yin deficiency and then starts from deficiency fire inside causing fire due to deficiency. If the fire is hot the yin will be more disabled. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly focus on nourishing yin fluid with a slight addition of clear solution. Be cautious not to overindulge in bitter cold which can turn dryness into yin damage. Zhou Zhongying said \"You can add some bitter and cold herbs such as Huanglian Huangqin and Shanzhi to the group of sour sweet cool and nourishing yin medicines as appropriate to clear the stomach and relieve the liver. Mix sourness and bitterness release heat and retain yin combine bitterness and sweetness and release heat and moisten dryness",

Often caused by internal injuries or insufficient yin and blood in the human body to nourish liver and wood; Or even more thoughtful with dark depletion of yin and blood and internal movement of liver fire; Or food fatigue fatigue spleen injury yin fire rising inside and liver fire multiplying spleen can also consume spleen injury. The so-called \"strengthening fire and eating qi\" can all become liver spleen deficiency fire syndrome. The liver spleen deficiency fire syndrome is characterized by the liver governing blood as yin and the spleen governing qi as yang. If the yin blood of the liver is insufficient then the deficiency fire will arise internally. If the spleen's vital energy is insufficient then the yin fire will be superior; The deficiency fire of the liver is vigorous and it also consumes energy and damages vital energy; The yang qi of the spleen is weak and it cannot transform into yin blood. Therefore its pathogenesis always belongs to deficiency of both qi and yin and internal steaming due to deficiency of heat. At the beginning the wooden fire tends to win while at the end it consumes qi and blood ultimately damaging qi and yin. The liver and spleen deficiency fire syndrome starts from deficiency so the treatment of fire should supplement its deficiency. Therefore the treatment principle should mainly focus on supplementing the vital energy of the spleen nourishing the yin and blood of the liver and also clearing and reducing its fire. If the spleen is greatly deficient and the Yin fire is high it can also be used to nourish the spleen with sweetness and warmth which is what You Zaijing said: \"When the earth is warm the fire is restrained.",

The liver lung deficiency fire syndrome originates from the deficiency of yin and blood in the liver causing internal combustion of liver fire and burning of lung gold. Therefore its pathogenesis begins with the accumulation of wood fire inside consuming the qi of the lung and damaging the blood vessels of the lung; Continuing to steam and burn the liver lung qi and yin will eventually cause the burning of yin and blood. The liver lung deficiency fire syndrome is always caused by the deficiency of both qi and yin. Liver fire invades the lungs causing the lungs to lose clarity and composure. Therefore its treatment principle is to clear and nourish qi and yin to soften the liver and then the deficiency fire will self extinguish.

        "description": "The liver and kidney deficiency fire syndrome is a deficiency fire syndrome characterized by insufficient yin and blood causing the fire to move in the lower jiao. The deficiency of yin and blood nourishes the liver and kidney resulting in the phase fire of the liver the dragon fire of the kidney and the internal movement losing storage resulting in the deficiency fire syndrome. Especially when the kidney yin is insufficient to match yang yin does not love yang causing yang to become excessive above resulting in a deficiency fire. In ancient times fire did not return to its roots or yin fire. It comes from the lower jiao yin branch and the fire in the water but it is different from the deficiency yang floating in the kidney yang deficiency. Due to its water deficiency and fire hyperactivity it is also known as a hyperactive dragon. Dragon fire inhabits the water but when it is cold it cannot be hidden and when it is hot it cannot be hidden. Both belong to dragon fire but there are differences in yin and yang. The liver and kidney deficiency fire syndrome is always caused by the deficiency of yin and blood elements in the person or due to overwork or excessive thinking or excessive blood loss during menstruation or damage to the semen in the atrium and ventricle resulting in dark damage to the essence and blood causing fire to move in the middle. Especially in the later stage of heat disease evil heat deeply sinks into the yin dissipates and burns yin blood and evil fire combines with the dragon. Its fire is particularly strong dissipating yin and consuming blood leading to changes in essence marrow and heat. True water consumes every day and water does not make fire. Yin does not match Yang so Yang is overpowering. Fei Boxiong said \"Yin deficiency and Yang are overpowering and the fire of dragons and thunder is surging. He Lianchen said \"If the fire does not return to its roots it is the fire of the dragon and thunder. Zhu Danxi said \"Kidney water deficiency is insufficient and the liver withers and the wood moves. It carries the phase fire again reaching a high peak.\" He Lianchen also said \"Liver and kidney yin deficiency leads to the inversion of phase fire.\" If it disturbs the heart master it will cause the monarch to lose peace. Insufficient kidney water can cause the wood fire to become excessive. However Wu Kun'an also said \"Shaoyang's phase fire is intense pushing Shaoyin back two young people lose their control and the disease and bandits are mild and shallow It is caused by excessive liver fire which can cause kidney water damage. Therefore the deficiency of liver and kidney in fire although there is a tendency towards excessive fire in the liver and a tendency towards ascending dragon fire in the kidney the two are mutually causal. The organs of the liver and kidney mother and child were said to have the same origin in ancient times so it is difficult to completely separate them. The liver and kidney deficiency fire syndrome is based on the deficiency of liver and kidney yin in the lower energizer and the evil fire carries the dragon phase internally. Therefore its governance principle should always nourish its yin and lower its fire. The ancient people called it the method of \"strengthening the master of water to control sunlight\". However to nourish the kidney yin and replenish its innate water He Lianchen once said \"If it is not a soothing and tranquilizing medicine and if there is love in the flesh and blood a large dose of nourishment cannot be used. However due to yin deficiency excessive wood deficiency insufficient kidney water and excessive phase fire it is important to consider the degree of excess and deficiency and determine the urgency of supplementing and reducing qi. Wu Kun'an once said \"It is advisable to relieve the stagnation of wood fire in an urgent manner in order to save the water of Shaoyin. If not urgently nourish the water of Shaoyin to aid the fire of Shaoyang which is the method of nourishing water and containing wood. As for the mismatch between yin and yang the fire of dragon thund",

The cause is lung Qi depression which does not dominate the process of descending and gradually leads to stomach Qi depression. It neither accepts nor descends resulting in both upper and middle Qi stagnation. In some cases lung Qi is not expelled stomach Qi does not descend and cannot regulate the water channel. It is also transmitted to the bladder leading to the failure of kidney qi circulation and unfavorable water channels. The depression of lung qi although located in the upper jiao is related to the pathogenesis of the middle and lower parts. The ancients said that the lungs are the main source of qi in the whole body. When the lung qi is released the qi of each organ is also released. The lung qi is dirty and stagnant and it is advisable to reduce dereliction of duty. If the qi is not released the qi of the three jiao organs cannot be released. The pathogenesis of lung and stomach qi stagnation syndrome lies in the stagnation of lung qi so its treatment principle is mainly to treat the lung. The lungs reside in the upper energizer and are responsible for the descending of qi. When the lung qi is released it can descend to the stomach and pass through the three energizers. Therefore when promoting lung qi then impurity and depression can be eliminated. The method of promoting lung qi should be light rather than heavy as Wu Jutong once said: \"The upper jiao is like a feather not light but not lifted.\" Xu Zhicai also has a method of removing the essence that is using a light and clear substance to promote lung qi. If the lung qi is cleared then the impurity and depression can be resolved and the descending order can be achieved.",

        "description": "Spleen and Stomach Qi Depression Syndrome: It is the fundamental disease of Qi stagnation in the middle energizer. The disease is caused by spleen and stomach stagnation or depression due to contemplation or stagnation of food leading to stagnation of the Qi mechanism in the middle energizer. The spleen and stomach control the central nervous system and the reason for the rise of clear qi and the decrease of turbid qi all depend on the spleen and stomach central nervous system. The central nervous system is stagnant and the spleen cannot exercise the power to promote health. The stomach qi does not control the decrease of turbid qi and the spleen cannot clear up resulting in the failure of clear up or turbid down. The spleen cannot transform and the stomach does not control the absorption resulting in a mixture of clear and turbid qi. The spleen and stomach are not harmonious and the rise and fall are out of balance. At first the stagnation of qi leads to stagnation and then it consumes the gas and liquid in the stomach ultimately damaging the spleen yang. Even if the spleen is unable to regulate the body fluid of the stomach the qi cannot regulate it and the body fluid stops and turns into water. If the qi is not favorable the water will also not function resulting in a disease of water qi. The spleen and stomach qi stagnation syndrome is a syndrome of qi stagnation in the middle energizer. Therefore its treatment principle should follow Wu Jutong's principle of \"treating the middle energizer as if it were right\" urgently dredging and benefiting the central nervous system eliminating the accumulation and stagnation of energy unblocking and lowering the qi mechanism and quickly removing its stagnation. But it is not advisable to attack recklessly. As Yu Genchu once said \"If you use attacking medicine to unblock it although it may temporarily be unblocked its closure is beneficial. If you force it to be unblocked and therefore shed blood it should be in harmony with the Qi. If the Qi is smooth it will be self unblocked",

The disease is caused by emotional distress or depression or anger that can damage the liver leading to depression of liver qi and loss of its ability to regulate and regulate leading to the stagnation of liver qi commonly known as liver depression which is commonly referred to as qi stagnation syndrome. The qi of liver depression not only affects the internal organs but also affects other organs affecting the spleen and stomach ascending and descending to the lungs and descending to the kidneys all of which are the combined symptoms of liver depression. The liver and gallbladder qi stagnation syndrome involves the gallbladder and internal organs. The liver and gallbladder are originally internal and external organs but still belong to the disease of the internal organs. Mild cases can lead to stagnation of liver qi while severe cases can lead to internal stagnation of qi resulting in stagnation of liver qi. The change is that the liver qi rushes from stagnation to the upper lower and inner and outer parts resulting in a horizontal transformation of liver qi. Over time qi and blood are depleted resulting in a mixture of deficiency and excess and a syndrome of liver qi imbalance. The syndrome of liver and gallbladder qi stagnation is caused by the loss of qi in the liver and stagnation in the internal organs. Therefore the treatment principle follows the \"Classic\" principle: \"Wood stagnation reaches it. When using the qi mechanism of dredging and benefiting the liver to smooth its flow and restore its ability to relieve stress; However the stagnation of liver qi originates from the imbalance of the seven emotions. The medicine is a merciless product of grass and trees which can only benefit the time and is difficult to break the root of its emotions. Therefore it is more expensive than medicine to nourish and nourish one's emotions avoid anger and sorrow and cultivate oneself with leniency.",

It is often caused by depression and anger that damages the liver or the stagnation of seven emotions leading to liver qi depression and inability to release internal stagnation of liver qi and transverse invasion of the spleen; Or due to overwork and excessive worry the temper cannot ascend to the liver causing the wood to stagnate in the soil and the liver qi to stagnate in the spleen; Or the deficiency of spleen and qi while the liver and qi are affected by it can all lead to the syndrome of liver and spleen stagnation commonly known as liver and spleen stagnation or spleen deficiency and liver hyperactivity in the soil of wood stagnation commonly known as stagnation syndrome or liver stagnation which is often referred to as this syndrome.

The liver and spleen qi stagnation syndrome or the qi of liver stagnation invading the spleen or the spleen deficiency leading to liver stagnation is called the\" soil defeated wooden thief \" The latter is called \"soil restlessness wood\". Although both are symptoms of liver qi invading the spleen liver hyperactivity and spleen deficiency the former tends to be more prone to liver hyperactivity resulting in liver qi deficiency and even rebellious symptoms. The latter tends to be more prone to spleen deficiency resulting in spleen qi deficiency stagnation or qi yin deficiency stagnation yin blood deficiency and dryness. The pathogenesis of liver spleen qi stagnation syndrome is always liver stagnation and spleen deficiency liver strength and spleen weakness. The treatment method should always be to soothe the liver and spleen and to support soil and suppress wood as its main method.

Over time it generates phlegm and turns into fire resulting in a syndrome of qi phlegm qi and fire. In some cases it can damage qi consume blood and gradually fall into the body and damage the door. The liver lung qi stagnation syndrome is caused by the lung which is originally caused by the liver. If the wood is not deducted from the gold the gold will not resonate. Therefore the pathogenesis of this syndrome is always due to the stagnation of the liver qi resulting in the stagnation of the lung qi and the failure to promote and lower it; In some cases the liver qi reverses and invades the lungs carrying the lung qi upwards resulting in a syndrome of liver lung qi inversion. The symptoms of this syndrome are liver lung qi stagnation laxity and sudden decline leading to sudden closure of the clear qi in the upper jiao resulting in a syndrome of closed syncope; Or if the qi does not flow down the waterway it can be transmitted to the bladder causing the kidney to experience gasification and loss of function. The liver lung qi stagnation syndrome is always caused by the liver stagnation qi invading the lungs causing lung qi stagnation but cannot control the liver.

At the beginning there is qi stagnation and blood stasis and at the end there is qi and blood stasis; Prolonged illness leads to a lack of vitality in the liver incompetence in spleen health dark depletion of liver blood and spleen qi resulting in a mixture of qi and blood deficiency and excess; Even if qi stagnation cannot regulate body fluids it can lead to cessation of water flow. If blood stasis persists for a long time it can also dissolve water. At the beginning the fluid qi does not dissolve and the water qi overflows and becomes swollen; For a long time the combination of qi and blood stasis leads to a critical state of qi enveloping blood bloating. The liver spleen qi stasis syndrome starts with the liver and ends with the spleen. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly focus on relieving stagnation of liver qi and if liver qi is relieved it has the power to relieve stagnation and can regulate the qi stagnation of the spleen; Moreover the flow of qi and blood can also flow and qi stagnation can flow smoothly and blood stasis can also follow suit. If blood stasis is already present the product of promoting blood circulation and eliminating blood stasis should also follow then there will be no stagnation of qi and blood and naturally there will be no changes in body fluid stagnation and dehydration; If water is formed and Qi and blood stasis are intertwined with water one should also follow the method of the \"Inner Canon\": \"Evil blood does not flow out the breast should be retained to stop the day should be beneficial and it can be directed down.",

The disease is caused by the stagnation of qi in the seven emotions which hinders the flow of qi and leads to the stagnation of qi in the lungs. As a result the qi in the lungs becomes stagnant and unable to distribute its body fluids leading to the accumulation of phlegm and qi resulting in the stagnation of phlegm and qi. This is also known as the syndrome of stagnation of qi in the seven emotions and stagnation of phlegm and saliva in ancient times. At the beginning of its pathogenesis it becomes stagnant and overheated and the clear yang qi loses its promotion and development. The disease is still shallow and mild; Long term stagnation obstructs the lung meridians leading to a syndrome of stagnation and obstruction. If it does not dissolve for a long time it can gradually lead to symptoms of stagnation that are difficult to resolve leading to a deep and severe illness. The liver lung qi phlegm syndrome is characterized by stagnation of liver lung qi and obstruction of lung phlegm. Therefore its treatment should always be based on regulating qi and phlegm and achieving it through dredging. And you should relieve liver depression to clear its source which is the ancient method of \"promoting qi depression\" \"regulating qi to open depression\" \"relieving liver depression\" and so on. However it is also necessary to promote lung and phlegm circulation to treat its symptoms. If the disease is related to emotions it is more important to cultivate one's emotions and emotions in order to smooth their emotions so that the liver qi is not depressed and there is no danger of superior rebellion against the lungs. The lung qi should be smooth and the application has the power so the body fluid flows and phlegm cannot be generated.",

        "description": "The liver stomach qi phlegm syndrome is a syndrome of stagnation of liver qi and stagnation of phlegm in the stomach organs. The cause of the disease is persistent depression of emotions loss of liver qi obstruction of liver qi and invasion of the stomach due to depression resulting in stagnation of body fluid in the stomach and the production of phlegm and saliva. This is a syndrome of liver stomach qi stagnation and phlegm stagnation. The liver stomach qi phlegm syndrome has three pathogenesis: firstly it invades the chest causing stagnation of the clear yang qi and in some cases stagnation of the clear yang qi in the chest ultimately leading to stagnation of the clear qi often resulting in chronic disease of choking and diaphragm; The second offense is to invade the stomach organs. If the stomach qi is shallow it will lose its balance and decrease. If it is deep it will stagnate the stomach yang. If it lasts for a long time it will consume the yang qi of the stomach or damage the stomach qi and gastric juice. Eventually it can lead to blood loss and damage to the stomach meridians; If the three stagnation occur in the liver then the wood fire of the liver is a disease. In mild cases the wood fire is stagnant and cannot be released. In severe cases the wood fire rushes upwards causing blood to flow for a long time. However when qi stagnation and blood stasis are observed or the yin blood of the disabled liver is damaged resulting in a combination of deficiency and excess. The liver stomach qi phlegm syndrome is a syndrome of stagnation of liver stomach qi and stagnation of phlegm. Phlegm arises from qi stagnation and the disease originates from qi. Therefore its treatment principle lies in relieving the stagnation of qi in the liver and stomach enabling the liver to relieve stress without stagnation of body fluid and without any reason for phlegm to develop. However phlegm can also stagnate qi. As He Xiushan once said \"Phlegm is related to the pulsation of qi and qi is stagnant due to phlegm while phlegm is stimulated by qi.\" Therefore phlegm should also be equally important in resolving phlegm. When phlegm is eliminated qi is smooth and there is no problem of stagnation of qi.",

For a long time the liver fire becomes more intense the wood fire rushes backwards and even the blood rises with the qi causing the disease to be most acute. Or due to the failure to treat qi and fire or excessive administration of products that are spicy warm dry hot and beneficial for qi which consume the gas and liquid in the stomach and damage the yin and blood in the liver there will be a mixture of deficiency and excess.

Initially it is due to the loss of liver qi for relaxation and stagnation in the spleen; Following this the liver fire is filled with internal energy and should not be let out rushing upwards; Even if it is related to the persistent food in the spleen it will turn into fire and become fiery inside. When it becomes solid qi and fire merge into a central focus while when it becomes empty it consumes gas and liquid and when qi and fire dry up it is a sign of a mixture of deficiency and reality. The liver spleen qi fire syndrome is characterized by stagnation of qi and internal fire. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to dredge and promote the stagnation of qi in the liver and spleen clear and lower the internal fire in the liver and spleen and allow the qi fire to descend so that there is no internal disturbance.",

The syndrome of liver lung qi fire is often caused by the failure of emotions internal stagnation of liver qi loss of its ability to release qi and the transformation of qi stagnation into fire which invades the lungs. The lungs lose their power to regulate and lower resulting in liver lung qi fire. The pathogenesis of this disease is always caused by the depression of liver qi the inability of wood fire to vent and the upwelling of qi and fire that invades the lungs. In mild cases it can hinder the release and descent of qi while in severe cases it can flush and reverse the swollen collaterals. Over time it will consume the yin fluid which is always caused by the upwelling of qi and fire in the liver. Therefore the treatment principle should always be to dredge the liver qi clear and lower the wood fire and at the same time to clear and eliminate the lung qi and promote its descent as the law.",

It is caused by the injury of yin cold qi to the lower jiao which suppresses the yang qi of the liver and kidney and causes stagnation of liver blood due to cold. Wu Kun'an said \"Blood coagulates due to cold \" which is commonly seen in women during menstruation and childbirth. Occasionally cold qi can cause stagnation in the liver and kidney meridians through the Chongren meridians. Therefore it is commonly seen in dysmenorrhea and amenorrhea during menstruation as well as postpartum blood and qi pain such as the formation of symptoms in cold coagulation which was formerly known as stone mass. Men also have lower jiao cold and dampness which leads to stagnation of the liver and kidney meridians and accumulation of blood stasis in the governor meridians resulting in blood stasis and low back pain. The liver and kidney cold stasis syndrome has mild pathogenesis with cold stasis stagnation and blood circulation being unfavorable; If it is severe it will stagnate the liver and kidney yang qi and the collaterals will become stagnant. Causes its transformation syndrome acute can block liver yang acute can cause syncope and detachment; If it is slow the qi and blood stasis will accumulate and cannot dissipate. The liver and kidney cold stasis syndrome is always suppressed by yin evil stagnation to lower the yang qi of the liver and kidney resulting in cold coagulation and blood stasis. Its treatment should be based on warming and unblocking the yang qi of the liver and kidney. When yang qi passes through cold coagulation can be resolved while blood stasis is feasible. Xie Yinglu said \"If blood gets cold it will coagulate and sob not be due to temperature blockage.",

The lungs reside in the upper energizer which governs qi and is the home of the clear yang qi. Cold and blood stasis block and the lung qi loses its power to ascend and descend. The clear yang qi loses its ability to ascend and expand. Therefore if it is shallow it will lead to a loss of clarity in qi while if it is severe it will lead to a stagnation of yang and depression; For a long time liver stasis and lung qi are in sync leading to qi stagnation and blood stasis; Drama stagnates the liver yang causing it to lose its circulation. The liver lung cold stasis syndrome always belongs to the syndrome of mutual stagnation of liver stasis and lung qi. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly promote the circulation of liver and lung yang qi dredge the qi and blood of the liver promote the reduction of stagnant lung qi and regulate the liver and lungs which is its main method.",

Both can cause blood heat and coagulate blood stasis. The syndrome of heart and liver stasis and heat is divided into two main types: the heart and liver and the pathogenesis is always caused by the accumulation of blood stasis and the internal movement of heart and liver wood fire. Therefore its pathogenesis can be divided into stasis and heat stagnation and stasis and heat accumulation and steaming: stasis and heat stagnation qi and blood lose their circulation wood fire cannot be released mild to qi stagnation outside or rushing up even qi and blood flow up collateral stasis and blood overflow; Or stay between the blood circulation and the meridians of the meridians; If blood stasis obstructs internal prosperity depression suppresses wood fire and stagnates the heart mind liver and soul; Dramatists who experience stasis and blockage of the mind experience a change of syncope. Stasis heat accumulation and steaming are caused by the heat generated by blood circulation which is concentrated within the body. Stagnation heat exchanges and evaporates resulting in the division of qi and blood in the heart liver and liver. Wood fire can also ignite within the body causing it to dissipate and burn the blood leading to excessive circulation of collateral blood; When a playwright's internal blood is burning there is an internal movement of the liver wind which leads to a transformation of the closed mind. The syndrome of heart liver stasis heat is generally caused by the stagnation of blood heat in the blood circulation so its treatment principle should be to clear the blood circulation and cool the blood circulation to eliminate heat and to dissipate blood circulation and promote blood stasis. He Lianchen once said \"It is advisable to clear heat and remove blood stasis simultaneously so that they can be resolved together.",

Mildly it can stagnate the lung qi or stagnate in the lung meridians or even compete with the qi of the lungs and stomach. This can result in qi and blood stasis in the upper and middle regions known as blood stasis in the chest in ancient times. This syndrome is characterized by blood stasis and overflow in the collaterals and blood flowing with the qi in the upper regions resulting in a syndrome of blood inversion. Alternatively stasis and heat can block the qi of the upper and middle regions to clear yang resulting in a syndrome of closed syncope. The syndrome of lung and stomach stasis and heat commonly known as the syndrome of upper and middle jiao accumulating blood is always characterized by stagnation of blood stasis and heat in the lung and stomach and the disorder of upper and middle qi in promoting and lowering. Therefore its treatment principle is to clear and promote blood stasis and heat promote blood circulation and disperse blood and facilitate its promotion and lowering; If the stagnation of blood and heat leads to stagnation and becomes evidence then it should still be falsely used to pass through and reduce and the accumulation of blood stasis should be quickly determined.

If the hundred treatments are ineffective it will not become tuberculosis and then it will become various internal and external carbuncle",

        "description": "Gastrointestinal stasis heat syndrome is a type of syndrome in which the gastrointestinal tract accumulates blood stasis to dissipate heat or accumulates blood due to heat. Due to the fact that a person is known to have persistent blood stasis they develop stasis heat by competing with the heat of the gastrointestinal tract; Or external pathogenic heat is transmitted to the gastrointestinal tract internally and after prolonged use blood stasis stops due to heat; The syndrome of gastrointestinal stasis and heat can be caused by the accumulation of heat in the gastrointestinal tract caused by the burning of alcohol or spicy hot substances gradually leading to blood stasis and stagnation. The ancients referred to it as the syndrome of blood stasis and heat in the interior and the gastrointestinal tract as the syndrome of Yangming interior. Stasis heat or stagnation in the stomach meridians resulting in blood stasis and stomach pain; Or it may end up in the stomach as hiccup or bloody diaphragm; Or it may accumulate in the intestines and become stagnant or even develop as intestinal carbuncle. Stasis heat can transform into internal heat and can also lead to madness and fainting. This is a syndrome of middle jiao stagnation heat and closing the upper jiao and clearing the orifices. When the fire is strong it can also block yin and form a positive pole like yin syndrome of true heat and false cold. Gastrointestinal stasis heat syndrome is a syndrome of blood accumulation and stagnation of fire and heat in the gastrointestinal tract. The stomach and intestines are all fu organs and the six fu organs are used for circulation. Therefore the principle of treatment is always to clear and reduce blood stasis and heat. Yu Genchu said \"In light cases it cools the blood and dissipates stasis to clear it in severe cases it breaks through the blood and expels stasis to attack it urgently and in extreme cases it is attacked severely. It is also known as \"searching for and removing blood stasis accumulation to eliminate it\" and \"removing blood stasis heat to eliminate roots\" both of which are methods of lowering blood stasis.",

        "description": "The syndrome of liver and kidney stasis and heat is the fundamental syndrome of lower jiao stasis and heat. It was formerly known as lower jiao accumulating blood. He Lianchen said \"Those who accumulate blood in lower jiao belong to the liver meridian Chongmai. The disease often starts from flashes falls falls or falls or if a woman's menstrual blood stasis is not pure and stays inside or if a man's semen is corrupted and dirty and accumulates inside it can cause the blood to accumulate and become stagnant heat. In addition typhoid fever and warm heat can transmit scorched blood to the lower body which can also cause stasis such as the heat in the blood chamber of a woman and the recovery of atrial fatigue after illness all of which have this syndrome. Stagnation of blood stasis and heat in the kidney meridians is referred to as low back pain; Stagnant in the liver meridian indicates less abdominal pain; If it is formed in the kidney it can be seen as stone drenching or cloudy drenching; If it is tied to the liver it is a hernia and sagging. The liver and kidney stasis heat syndrome has a mild pathogenesis of stagnation either in the liver meridians or in the kidney meridians or in mutual stagnation with the qi of the liver and kidney. Extreme stagnation can lead to inversion; If it is heavy it will stagnate and accumulate either in the kidneys or in the liver; Stagnation for a long time often damages the liver and kidney yin blood and yang qi resulting in a syndrome of deficiency and excess. The liver and kidney stasis heat syndrome is a syndrome where blood stasis heat accumulates in the lower energizer. Therefore its treatment principle should be based on the principle of dredging diuresis and lowering blood pressure so as to remove blood stasis heat from the lower orifice; In mild cases it can dissipate blood stasis and heat while in severe cases it can regulate qi and clear blood stasis and heat; Even if it disperses blood and breaks through the blood stasis it can expel the blood stasis and heat from the two yin sources; Ensure that the meridians and collaterals are smooth and there will be no symptoms of stagnation.",

In ancient times the liver was used as the blood sea and blood chamber and the heat in the liver caused stagnation of liver blood gradually leading to stasis and internal accumulation. Therefore it is often referred to as the \"hot human blood chamber\"; Or it is called the accumulation of blood in the lower part of the liver. He Lianchen's Day; Those who accumulate blood in the lower energizer belong to the liver meridian Chongmai. It is a disease that can cause mild stagnation of the central nervous system gradually leading to stagnation and even stagnation; In severe cases depression suppresses the transformation of fire initially attacking the stomach meridians gradually causing a reversal of wood fire. In severe cases there may be changes in accumulation spasms and convulsions. Therefore its treatment principle should always be based on relieving blood stasis and heat as Zhong Jing once said: \"Take it according to the actual situation\" method; Either dredge the cardinal mechanism or lower the wooden fire and let it flow according to the actual situation.

The so-called restlessness of the earth and the lack of vitality in the wood can lead to liver stagnation due to dampness in the spleen. Over time it gradually becomes stasis and heat. Therefore He Lianchen said \"It is often due to liver stagnation and collateral stasis or dampness and heat occupying the middle energizer.\" Stagnation of stasis and heat in the spleen can lead to blood stasis and abdominal pain stagnation in the liver can lead to blood stasis and hypochondriac pain stagnation of blood stasis and heat can lead to symptoms bloating and amenorrhea in women. Over time it can lead to dry blood consumption. The liver belongs to wind wood while the spleen belongs to damp soil. The syndrome of liver and spleen stasis and heat is often accompanied by liver wind or spleen dampness. At the beginning of its pathogenesis it is characterized by qi stagnation and blood stasis while the liver and spleen are mainly involved in blood circulation so it is also often associated with stagnation of blood circulation. Stagnation and stagnation can lead to stagnation of qi and blood for a long time and even result in the spleen being unable to transport and store water which is a syndrome of stagnant heat leading to water and qi. There are two types of symptoms: either the liver turns into wood and fire with internal redness exceeding yin and blood; Or dampness of the spleen can damage yang resulting in yang deficiency and stagnation; The principle of treatment should always be to dissipate blood stasis and heat and to promote the circulation of the liver and spleen meridians; Alternatively it can also quench the wind or participate in dampness and dryness to regulate the liver and spleen; Disease is related to emotions and it is more important to cultivate one's emotions and nourish one's character in order to supplement the shortcomings of plants and plants.",

Phlegm and blood stasis block the liver and stomach causing turbid pathogens to ascend and reverse clearing the upper trunk and clearing the channels occupying the yang position with yin. The stomach qi loses its normal circulation and descending and in severe cases it stagnates the stomach meridians causing the collaterals to lose their smoothness; For a long time blood stasis will accumulate in the liver and stomach and the accumulation is difficult to dissipate. Therefore its treatment principle should be to expel phlegm and eliminate blood stasis and to dredge and benefit the liver and stomach.",

Good results from the accumulation of dampness in the spleen the accumulation of dampness and the generation of phlegm or the accumulation of dampness and evil or the dampness of diet. As Zhang Yuqing said \"excessive consumption of sweet and greasy substances leads to the accumulation of dampness and the generation of phlegm.\" The dampness and phlegm go against the lungs causing the loss of the right to promote and lower lung qi resulting in the syndrome of dampness and phlegm in the lungs and spleen. As the ancients said \"The spleen is the source of phlegm and the lungs are the organs for storing phlegm; Drama has a transformation of stagnation and closure of the lung and orifices. Deficiency of temper stagnation of phlegm and dampness in the spleen and inability to promote qi deficiency and phlegm stagnation are symptoms of qi deficiency and phlegm stagnation; Even if the operation of the camp and defense is weak phlegm dampness stagnates in the meridians; Or if one's temper is unable to regulate the flow of water and fluid and the triple energizer is activated and the bladder is infused downwards there may be a change in the cessation of fluid accumulation. The syndrome of dampness and phlegm in the lung and spleen is characterized by phlegm originating from the spleen and the disease occurs in the lung. The lung and spleen are both affected so the treatment principle should be to dry the spleen and promote dampness to dissipate phlegm and turbidity and to promote the circulation and transformation of lung qi; The lung and spleen are treated together as Lei Shaoyi once said: \"The spleen should be mainly treated and the infiltration of dampness and phlegm should be supplemented; As the saying goes \"Dampness accumulates phlegm and phlegm gas rushes to the lungs. It is important to regulate the spleen and assist in promoting the lungs.",

It is often caused by external pathogenic factors and is a disease of phlegm entrapment caused by external factors; Although external evil is eliminated phlegm and heat are not cleared; Or there may be many changes due to excessive pathogenic factors and phlegm heat. In acute cases it can lead to lung distension lung obstruction lung closure and chest enlargement; Mild symptoms include phlegm cough phlegm asthma phlegm asthma and can also be transmitted to various syndromes such as pulmonary malaria phlegm malaria and summer malaria all caused by upper middle heat and phlegm stagnation. The pathogenesis of heat phlegm stagnation in the lungs and stomach can be divided into two types: either stagnation in the lungs or stagnation in the stomach. Depression in the lungs can lead to lung qi. In mild cases qi loss should be reduced while in severe cases it can damage and deplete lung fluid leading to lung failure to clear the market. Its changes: in reality there are changes in lung closure and lung obstruction while in deficiency there are problems with depletion of qi and yang and even the danger of detachment. If the stomach is depressed then the disease is related to the qi of clearing yang in the middle; Mild depression can suppress its descent severe depression can stagnate its yang qi or stagnate its pivot; Or accumulate steam in it consuming its body fluids. Its changes: in fact there are stagnation and stagnation; There is even a risk of depression while deficiency can cause damage to the air and gas leading to stomach yin. The lung and stomach heat phlegm syndrome is formed by steaming the lung and stomach fluids with heat so its treatment principle should always be based on clearing the heat in the lung and stomach clearing the heat to dissipate phlegm which is what Yu Genchu called \"clearing and dispersing the heat\" method and Wang Mengying also called \"opening the lung and clearing the stomach\" method. Therefore clearing and eliminating the heat accumulation in the lung and stomach dredging and promoting the qi mechanism of the lung and stomach making heat clear and qi beneficial and body fluid popular then phlegm will not grow; It is advisable to lower the lung and stomach clear and dissipate phlegm heat which is the only method for the syndrome of lung and stomach phlegm heat.",

The family of typhoid fever refers to it as Shaoyang Syndrome either as a meridian syndrome or as a viscera syndrome. It is a syndrome where there is phlegm and heat in the stomach which is triggered by external evil. The evil heat and phlegm drink fight each other initially stagnating the pivot then phlegm and heat stagnate and steam in the interior and for a long time it becomes stagnant and suppresses the wood fire in the gallbladder unable to vent and in some cases it becomes stagnant and upwardly rebellious Disturbing the empty orifice and causing reflux in the stomach.

Phlegm and fire accumulate in the lungs causing the lungs to lose their power to clear and regulate. If they accumulate in the stomach the stomach will lose its ability to regulate and regulate and even stagnate the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle regions causing people to lose their ability to regulate and regulate. Phlegm and fire stagnation in the upper regions can lead to phlegm confusion and irritability; Stagnation in the lungs can lead to changes such as chest congestion pulmonary obstruction and pulmonary carbuncle. However fire always belongs to yang evil and over time it will consume yin fluid so there will also be changes in gas and liquid qi yin or yin fluid disability in the later stage. The syndrome of phlegm and fire in the lung and stomach is characterized by the accumulation of phlegm and fire in the upper and middle qi. Therefore its treatment principle should be based on clearing fire and clearing phlegm and should also promote the descending of the upper and middle qi mechanism to clear the yang qi. Wu Kun'an said \"It is advisable to open the bi qi in the qi division so that the clear yang can be relieved in order to achieve enlightenment that is to gently clear and lift the lung qi and release the upper jiao. However for a long time Jin Zijiu had the concept of \"clearing phlegm from the diaphragm and removing stagnation from the internal organs.\" Yu Genchu also said \"The method should be used to treat both the lung and large intestine and to activate and lower lung qi to relieve bowel movements. The lungs and the large intestine are essentially external and internal while the gastrointestinal tract is also connected.

It is caused by the person's excessive liver fire element which reversely multiplies with the lung and stimulates the accumulation of phlegm in the lung resulting in the liver lung phlegm fire syndrome. However phlegm and fire accumulate in the lungs causing disorders in the joints. Gold does not make wood causing the liver to generate wind and wind and fire can stir in the lungs which can also cause liver and lung diseases. The ancients said: liver qi rushes into the lungs not lung diseases fire floats on the surface and purification is not effective. Fire refines the body fluid in the lungs to form phlegm which can also be generated by liver fire. Its pathogenesis is caused by liver fire and phlegm heat leading to the loss of the ability to clear and eliminate the lungs. In some cases stagnation of the lung meridians or stagnation in the chest can become serious symptoms. Its symptoms may include phlegm fire or channeling through meridians or even coalescing inside and outside the skin making it difficult to dissipate after formation. The principle of treatment should always be to clear the liver and clear the lungs purge the fire and transform phlegm.",

Due to the internal movement of liver fire it runs horizontally in the stomach excites phlegm and turbidity in the stomach and becomes a syndrome of liver stomach phlegm and fire due to pulse stimulation. Alternatively due to external warming and heat yang pathogenic factors it can sink into the human body or due to shock it can activate liver fire causing the liver fire to go up and invade the stomach causing phlegm to move up. Therefore it is commonly referred to as liver fire multiplying the stomach; Or the syndrome of Jueyin transforming fire and invading the stomach with phlegm. The liver fire stirs up hot phlegm and rushes upwards. Wu Kun'an said \"The liver fire is superior to the stomach and when it passes through the stomach it invades the lungs.\" In mild cases the upper trunk clears the channels and disturbs the empty orifices; If it is heavy it will become stagnant and hot in the interior causing phlegm and fire to reverse and causing loss of stomach qi; The playwright's wood fire is fiery the ascent and inversion are too excessive and the phlegm is turbid and obscured often resulting in a change of closed syncope. Zhang Yuqing once said \"Phlegm heat stagnation obstructs the lungs and stomach and the armor and wood do not fall. The armor and wood rise alone fearing wind and fire internal rotation causing confusion and convulsion. The liver stomach phlegm fire syndrome is always a syndrome of phlegm stagnation suppressing liver fire wood fire burning inside phlegm stagnation suppressing outside and phlegm stagnation and fire burning. Therefore its treatment principle should always clear phlegm and fire purge the liver and stomach; Clearing phlegm and heat to open its depression and suppress to release and lower wood fire and to control its thrusting; Those who are in great power should be taken down from the discharge.

For those who close the mind internally they should also open and close the mind to awaken the mind; For those who experience detachment due to closure it is better to use ginseng to nourish qi and solidify detachment. However in the case of Qi deficiency phlegm stagnation and qi stagnation should be promoted to promote the mechanism of lowering Qi and promote phlegm; For those in the camp it is important to clear away the camp heat activate the evil forces that are trapped inside and turn out the qi to separate and resolve them; People with blood should cool their blood and relieve heat; People who are yin should also nourish yin fluid which is what Ding Ganren said: \"Nourishing and transforming the source to clear temperature clearing the mind and clearing phlegm.",

        "description": "Spleen stomach phlegm fire syndrome is a syndrome of spleen stomach dampness phlegm transforming into fire and is one of the primary diseases of phlegm fire. Due to the presence of dampness and phlegm in the spleen and stomach or excessive consumption of spicy and hot roasted foods to aid stomach fire or external warming and heat the spleen and stomach are transmitted to transform fire and fight against persistent phlegm resulting in the syndrome of phlegm and fire. Therefore there is often food stagnation and even a fight against intestinal debris with phlegm and fire coming from the stomach to the intestine He Lianchen said Phlegm fire accumulates in the stomach and intestines and if it persists for a long time it becomes trapped between the gastrointestinal membranes and collaterals resulting in stubborn phlegm and old phlegm. It is sticky and firm either condensed from stagnant heat to form phlegm or converted from stagnant drink to turbid phlegm. If the disease is mild it may stagnate in the middle energizer causing disharmony of stomach qi and loss of qi. If it persists it may interfere with the clearing of the digestive tract or cause loss of stomach qi. Its symptoms may include stagnation of the qi in the upper energizer to clear yang or it may flow down to the intestines competing with the dross in the intestines and becoming incandescent in the middle. If it persists for a long time it may cause damage to the gastric juice resulting in The change of drying up. Its treatment should always be based on the same method of purging fire and drying phlegm as it comes from damp phlegm so it should naturally be dried and damped to dissipate phlegm. However it has already turned into fire so it must also be cleared and pursed to eliminate its fire; Even worse the method of releasing and dropping phlegm should be used to attack the old and stubborn phlegm. If the phlegm goes away there will be no fire attached and it will go away on its own. Moreover the spleen and stomach are connected to the intestine so the false intestine can be used as a way out. Therefore the method of clearing and lowering diarrhea is an important way to clear the phlegm and fire in the spleen and stomach. He Lianchen said \"Bitter bitter salty and descending to cleanse it clear and eliminate diarrhea and clear the intestines and stomach.",

        "description": "The Lung Spleen Phlegm Fire Syndrome is a syndrome of dampness phlegm invading the lung and transforming it into fire. It is caused by dampness phlegm in the spleen attacking the lung causing stagnation of lung qi to turn into fire. The lung loses the order of clearing and clearing and there is no right to declare and lower it. In some cases phlegm or inversion may occur and the lung qi does not decrease. Urgent cases indicate asthma while slow cases indicate asthma. It is most difficult to eradicate. It is marked by the lung which is originally in the spleen. The spleen is the organ of storage eating in the stomach and dispersing essence in the spleen. The spleen is characterized by phlegm stagnation and health disorders resulting in excessive food stagnation. Therefore the Lung Spleen Phlegm Fire Syndrome often has cases of food stagnation And it is caused by the stagnation of phlegm and food. Phlegm originates from the spleen fire stagnates in the lungs and phlegm rises with fire. Stagnation in the lungs can lead to dereliction of duty in promoting the decline of lung qi inversion of lung qi stagnation of phlegm and turbidity and even stagnation in the chest resulting in a lack of proper circulation of clear qi and unfavorable lifting and lowering. In severe cases phlegm and turbidity may cause blockage of clear yang sudden closure of clear orifices and internal turmoil of the mind; Or phlegm and fire may flow down the intestines causing stagnation due to the accumulation of intestinal debris. The main principle of its treatment is to eliminate phlegm and reduce fire relieve bitterness and clear away heat urgently eliminate phlegm and fire and promote the circulation of lung qi. This is the method of treating symptoms in case of urgency; Continuing to regulate the spleen and eliminate phlegm removing accumulated phlegm and pruning its roots is the method of slowing down and treating the root cause.",

Due to excessive dampness and phlegm shock or qi stagnation the internal movement of wood fire can cause dampness and phlegm to cover the pericardium resulting in the syndrome of heart gallbladder phlegm and fire. Wang Xugao replied \"Damp heat generates phlegm which is left in the organs of hands and feet with Shaoyang and affects the pericardium.\" Wu Kun'an said \"Heart qi is deficient and there is latent phlegm inside. Liver and gallbladder wood fire multiply with deficiency and invade the heart.\" Both are symptoms of phlegm stagnation and fire movement commonly known as phlegm irritability. Due to illness originating from shock it was also known as gallbladder deficiency or heart qi deficiency in ancient times. Phlegm originates from the stomach and there is phlegm dampness in the stomach so it is also known as stomach disharmony. Its mark is in the heart and gallbladder and its origin is still in the stomach. At the beginning of the disease it is due to the weakness of the gallbladder and the deficiency of phlegm. Although it is a syndrome of deficiency in the day it is actually evil stagnation so it often turns into a syndrome of dampness phlegm stagnation and wood fire; There may even be a transformation of closed wood fire. Therefore its treatment principle although it refers to the deficiency of heart and gallbladder qi does not lie in nourishing but in clearing phlegm and fire; Clearing the fire of the heart and gallbladder clearing the phlegm in the stomach ensures that the heart and gallbladder are not deficient and the stomach qi is also harmonious. Therefore He Lianchen said \"The method should be to expel phlegm and reduce fire.\" Yu Genchu also said \"By opening hot phlegm with coolness the mind will clear itself.\" Wu Kun'an advocated for \"calming the mind and mind to eliminate phlegm.\" It is not advisable to use empty words to supplement but instead to close phlegm and assist fire.

This can cause sudden movement of the liver wind stir up dampness and phlegm in the spleen and mask the mind causing stagnation and suppression of heart fire. If it is not reached properly and the spirit is disrupted it is called heart wind; Or the wind and phlegm are reversed the depression is closed and the Jiao is closed the clear Yang is closed and the wood fire is stagnant and hot causing sudden closure of the heart and mind commonly known as phlegm confusion and clearing the body. Cao Renbo said \"The wind is the heart meridian accumulating heat and steaming phlegm and phlegm fire is the heart\" or even as Xu Lingtai said \"Cover the wind and meridians and the internal wind and external wind fan each other resulting in the blockage of phlegm fire at one time.

Not only does water dampness become phlegm but body fluids also stop accumulating and reverse to form phlegm. If the deficiency of the spleen and kidney leads to phlegm spreading in the lungs then the lung qi loses its ability to promote and lower; Or stop in the middle and overflow; In some cases the kidney yang weakens and loses its ability to absorb it.

        "description": "Spleen and stomach water drink syndrome is the fundamental disease of middle jiao water drink which is caused by overeating raw and cold fruits or excessive addiction to tea and wine depression of spleen and stomach yang qi and dampness starting from the inside; Either external dampness or internal stagnation of the spleen and stomach can cause the loss of the ability to promote and transmit the yang qi of the spleen and stomach and the inability to transport the essence of water and grains. When the body fluid stops accumulating and becomes a water drink stopping in the stomach can cause epigastric pain. In ancient times it was called Zhiyin or Fuyin and when the water stops at the heart and overflows between the skin of the skin it is edema. When it accumulates in the outer membrane of the intestine it is water swelling or phlegm bloating. Spleen and Stomach Water Drink Syndrome: Water drink originates from the spleen and stomach and stagnates in the spleen and stomach. Water is a yin evil which will inevitably stagnate and retreat from the upper middle yang qi or ascend to clear the path with yin occupying the yang position causing the upper jiao to clear the yang position and lose its position; Or if it stops accumulating in the stomach there will be a disharmony of stomach yang and the stomach qi will lose its ability to lower and absorb; Even if it stops accumulating in the spleen the spleen yang is stagnant unable to transport and transform body fluids resulting in indistinguishable water and grain; Its changes may overflow between the skin and muscular striae or accumulate in the abdomen and intestines resulting in swelling; For those who suffer from spleen deficiency for a long time how can Lian Chen say: \"Spleen deficiency cannot promote the flow of body fluids to the stomach causing water to accumulate in the membrane and become swollen\" which is also a combination of deficiency and excess. The syndrome of spleen and stomach water consumption is characterized by stagnation of spleen and stomach yang qi resulting in the inability of body fluid to dissipate qi and stop accumulating. Therefore its treatment principle should always be to warm and unblock the spleen and stomach yang qi in order to dissipate qi and promote water circulation. Therefore the first major method is to unblock yang which is what Wu Kun'an said: \"It is advisable to use Xin to unblock it. However if the water is too strong it is necessary to urgently expel it and stop the water supply; The so-called drainage lowering and unblocking are based on decision-making. For those who have been ill for a long time and have a weak temper and are unable to exercise their body fluids they should also strengthen the spleen and promote water circulation.

        "description": "The syndrome of lung stomach water consumption is characterized by persistent drinking in the stomach and upper reflux invading the lungs. Zhang Zhongjing said \"There is cold in the chest \" while Yu Genchu said \"Phlegm lies on the diaphragm. In later generations it is commonly known as the phlegm yin type of typhoid fever which is caused by the cessation of drinking in the stomach or by external sensations such as wind cold and heat dampness or by the early release of clear and cold dampness on the surface syndrome causing the external evil to sink in and compete with the cessation of drinking in the stomach. As Yu Genchu once said \"This water and heat stagnation are intertwined in the chest abdomen lungs and stomach. If it accumulates in the chest it is called water accumulation in the chest or chest obstruction. If it accumulates in the lungs it is called branch drinking. If it accumulates in the chest and hypochondrium it is called retention drinking. If it accumulates under the hypochondrium it is called retention drinking. If it accumulates between the skin it is called retention drinking. If it accumulates between the limbs it is also called retention drinking. The Lung Stomach Water Drink Syndrome is characterized by the upwelling of stomach water in the lungs and the clearing of yang qi in the upper middle which bears the brunt. Mild symptoms can lead to stagnation severe symptoms can lead to stagnation and even stagnation. These are all symptoms of the loss of clear yang qi in the promotion and expansion of qi and the inability to separate qi. They can also penetrate deep into the bloodstream and cause symptoms of stagnation and obstruction but they are all symptoms of stagnation and accumulation in the chest abdomen and flank. If it overflows or overflows between the skin's striae the yang qi cannot be dissipated; Or if it flows between the joints of the limbs the meridians are blocked. As Zhong Jing once said \"Drinking water is popular and it belongs to the limbs.\" This is also what Wang Yusan said: \"The qi of clear yang cannot be applied to the limbs. The lung stomach water drink syndrome is caused by the cessation of water flow in the stomach so its treatment principle is to use the method of clearing yang transforming qi and promoting water circulation for mild cases; If the situation is heavy it should be vomited and profited from and the water should be stopped by driving it away with severity; From the upper part of the stomach to the mouth from the lower part to the two intestines and from the stomach where there is no water all can gush and vomit from the upper part and from the lower part to make a sharp decision",

According to Yu Genchu the syndrome is characterized by \"prolonged accumulation of spleen water and retrograde flow in the lungs\". It is necessary for a person to have a persistent drink in their spleen or external pathogenic factors such as wind cold and dampness that cause it to rise in the lungs. There are also external pathogenic factors such as wind cold and dampness that cause it to mistakenly nourish the lungs. They may also be affected by heat drink cold water or have a fever when drinking cold water or when drinking alcohol when the wind or when bathing when the wind blows. This can cause the water to move inward in the spleen and overflow in the lungs resulting in the syndrome of lung and spleen water consumption. This syndrome is caused by the sensation of wind and cold and was formerly known as the syndrome of the sun organs or the syndrome of water inversion. Those who drink cold due to heatstroke formerly known as those who drink in the sun. Those who experience heat and dampness are called Taiyin heat and warmth. Seen as a self sweating and night sweating person formerly known as a leak. Those who see swelling are called spleen water. The syndrome of lung and spleen water consumption is always caused by external pathogenic sensations in the lungs which touch the spleen and cause excessive drinking and then spread to the lungs. Mild depression can suppress lung yang leading to abnormal lowering of lung qi; If it is heavy it will stagnate the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle parts and cannot be propagated inside and outside resulting in the same disease on the surface and inside. The syndrome is characterized by internal stagnation and external overflow of water and qi. At the beginning it is characterized by stagnation of yang qi which cannot transform yin turbidity leading to internal accumulation and external flooding of water and qi. Prolonged stagnation of qi stagnation of body fluids and water and qi and even internal accumulation of water and qi resulting in swelling. The syndrome of lung and spleen water consumption is characterized by the reversal of water consumption in the spleen to the lungs. Therefore its treatment principle should always promote lung qi and release water qi from the surface; Dry the spleen and promote dampness allowing water and qi to flow from below; The combination of sweat and profit is used to determine its water quality which is also the principle of \"opening ghost gates and purifying the mansion\" in the Inner Canon for water management. However in ancient times the method of pouring out water and spreading it is commonly used such as drinking in the sun during the reign of Zhongjing saying \"This summer moon hurts cold water and the water flows through the skin causing it to be scattered with a melon stem. Wu Jutong said \"Guadi is gushing out its evil and the heat and dampness are resolved and the clear yang is restored. Lu Yangyu also said \"This evil is in the upper energizer and the higher it is the more it is. Later Wu Kun'an said 'Scattering and benefiting also resolves' which is why it is rare for later generations to use spitting techniques.",

        "description": "Gastrointestinal water drink syndrome is a syndrome of water drink flowing from the stomach to the intestines. It is a syndrome of water drink stopping in the stomach and flowing down into the intestines resulting in gastrointestinal water drink. If it stays in the stomach it is called retention drink. It can stop and suppress stomach yang with water drink and can cause stomach pain formerly known as heartache; Even if it forms a ruffian knot ancient people called it a nest sac; Staying in the intestines is referred to as \"staying to drink and wanting to go\" by Zhong Jing and in modern times it is called intestinal obstruction with fluid accumulation in the intestinal cavity. The symptoms are very urgent and dangerous. Water drink comes from the stomach which must first accumulate in the stomach to suppress the yang qi in the stomach. If it goes up the stomach yang will become disharmonious and if the stomach qi goes up it will go against the stomach qi leading to the loss of appetite; In the middle it accumulates in the stomach in the light it becomes a ruffian and in the extreme it becomes what the honest officials call a pouch; The lower part accumulates in the intestine As Zhong Jing once said \"A person who desires self-interest benefits quickly and the heart becomes firm and full this is the desire to retain and drink. When water stops accumulating in the stomach and intestines light cases can still pass through the yang to transform qi and promote water while heavy cases can use a diuretic to expel it urgently. The stomach and intestines are connected with the upper part coming from the mouth and the lower part flowing through the intestine. Therefore from the top one can vomit and expel it. From the bottom one can release the benefits and expel it and directly determine its nest. However the behavior below the stomach qi is smooth so it is more convenient to seize and expel it from the bottom.",

The ancients said \"Water qi goes against the heart and sneaks between the diaphragm.\" Wu Kun'an said \"This subdued drink lies in the liver meridians. In the liver stomach water drink syndrome the water evil comes from the stomach so it is easy to stagnate the yang qi of the stomach first and the liver qi must take advantage of it resulting in disharmony between the liver and stomach; Even drinking water can cause depression and pivot failure resulting in pivot failure; Drama involves drinking water to suppress yin and evil suppressing wood fire and not allowing it to overflow rushing up and down or disturbing and clearing resulting in a loss of tranquility in the empty body. Therefore the treatment principle is to quickly touch its water and drink it to soothe the liver and gallbladder while in mild cases it can be used to warm and promote yang qi to promote water circulation.

        "description": "The syndrome of liver and spleen water consumption is characterized by liver stagnation and spleen stagnation resulting in the cessation of water consumption. It can be caused by liver qi depression liver qi invading the spleen spleen qi stagnation and loss of its ability to transport and transform water. It can also be caused by the stagnation of spleen dampness and internal stagnation which suppresses liver qi and leads to the loss of liver circulation. This can lead to the cessation of body fluid storage and the formation of water consumption syndrome. The main cause of the disease is due to external heat dampness internal emotional disturbance or both internal and external factors resulting in liver and spleen disorders and water qi overflow; Mildly it can stagnate the spleen yang and lose its ability to transport and transform; Even if it stagnates the upper middle yang qi the liver qi becomes turbid and goes against it; The change is that Qi does not transform into Tianjin but into water and water and gas are intertwined resulting in swelling and swelling. The treatment should start with removing water and drinking. For those with mild symptoms the Yang Qi of the liver and spleen should be unblocked to promote water circulation. Wu Jutong advocates \"first attacking the Chongqi\" and \"warming the Chongmai\" that is warming and unblocking the liver Yang attacking the Yin turbid and retrograde Qi and \"attacking kidney evil\" means warming and unblocking the Yang Qi to transform Qi and promote water circulation. For those who are in a strong position their qi and water are intertwined and they should be driven out of water first. Yu Genchu proposed to \"divide and eliminate the stagnation in order to eliminate it; once the swelling subsides by 70-8% use Baizhu and Zhongtang to eliminate the root and improve the aftermath\". He Lianchen said \"In the medicine for treating bloating I add the product of promoting blood circulation and unblocking collaterals. However those caused by external factors are relatively easy to treat; And those who are caused by internal factors are more difficult to achieve full success. With its disease related emotions it is necessary to soothe the liver regulate the spleen and regulate the body; Otherwise although water discharge may be quick for a while it cannot ultimately cut off the source of its water production. Therefore in addition to medication it is more important to cultivate one's temperament and maintain the harmony of the liver and spleen in order to regulate the liver and spleen and break the root of its water intake.

        "description": "Spleen kidney water drink syndrome is the fundamental disease of lower jiao water drink. Either the spleen dampness flows down the stagnation suppresses the kidney yang or the inability of the kidney yang to transform qi into water causes the water qi to flow up to the spleen causing the spleen to lose its power of health and circulation and the water qi stops accumulating in the middle resulting in the syndrome of spleen kidney water consumption. Water vapor inversion can lead to symptoms such as water inversion dizziness and running dolphin. Water vapor storage can lead to bladder water storage cold shower urinary incontinence decadent hernia and water hernia. The water vapor flows downwards and there is also a symptom of diarrhea due to drinking. Overflow of water and gas can lead to edema while accumulation of water and gas can lead to water bloating cold bloating qi wrapped water bloating and spleen and kidney bloating. Both are caused by the inability of the spleen to produce water and the inability of the kidneys to produce water. The syndrome of spleen and kidney water consumption is always caused by the stagnation of spleen and kidney yang qi resulting in the stagnation of water and stagnation of storage. Water drinking is the evil of yin turbidity. If it stagnates in the spleen the spleen yang will lose circulation and the water will stop in the middle of the jiao; Stagnation in the kidney leads to the loss of kidney yang and the inability to transform qi into water; When water is consumed and stored Yang Qi does not dissipate and it cannot be transmitted to the bladder. In some cases it may reverse and cause the upper trunk to clear the path with Yin occupying the Yang position. Causing its symptoms to change either between the exocrine striae or in the abdomen gathering in the intestinal adventitia; Over time the kidney yang becomes increasingly deficient the spleen yang decays and the yin becomes increasingly turbid resulting in a syndrome of yang decline and yin excess. The treatment of Spleen and Kidney Water Drink Syndrome lies in warming and activating the Yang Qi of the spleen and kidney to assist in its gasification. When gasification occurs the water can be transformed into Qi and move forward. Therefore the principle of \"warming\" is advocated by Hua Bo Ren and the method of \"promoting Yang and promoting water\" and \"transforming Qi and promoting water\" was used by Yu Genchu. If it lasts for a long time the yang qi of the spleen and kidney will gradually decline and the turbid yin will become more abundant which is what Yu Genchu called \"spleen and kidney yang deficiency yin turbidity is everywhere\". In addition it is necessary to warm and supplement yang to promote yin turbidity. Wu Kun'an once said \"To strengthen the Yuanyang and eliminate the Yin shadow to cultivate the Yang soil and eliminate the Yin water then the opening and closing are appropriate and urination is self beneficial. Be cautious not to act recklessly in attacking and expelling instead damaging the spleen and kidney yang qi.",

The upward inversion of yin turbidity is a symptom resulting in the transformation of excess and deficiency. The spleen stomach cold drink syndrome is caused by the loss of the middle yang in circulation causing the cold evil to sink in and the body fluid to not melt. Therefore its treatment principle should mainly focus on warming and promoting the middle yang which is the principle advocated by Yu Genchu: \"warming and strengthening the spleen yang elevating the stomach qi\" then the cold drink will act on its own. Be cautious not to throw yourself into the cold. Zhang Zhongjing once said \"If you attack the heat you will vomit; therefore if you are weak in the stomach you will also feel cold; if you attack the heat you will vomit. Wu Kun'an also said \"Those who are not as hot as Yang Ming cannot be attacked; if attacked they must be treated as a chronic disease.",

The lung stomach yin heat syndrome is characterized by upper energizer with lung qi being the first to be affected; Drinking heat can cause stagnation in the lungs while in mild cases it can suppress lung qi and cause lung qi to become inappropriate; If it is severe it will hinder its descent leading to the loss of lung qi; If the heat cannot be released steaming and burning can clear the qi and the stagnation of heat can cause a syndrome of clear qi stagnation or Jin Qi incandescence inversion. If the steam persists for a long time drinking heat can cause stagnation or it can be obstructed in the chest or in the lung meridians then there is a change in stagnation. The syndrome of lung and stomach drinking heat is characterized by water drinking carrying heat pathogenic factors so its treatment principle is to use Xin Wen Tong Yang to expel heat pathogenic factors. Yu Genchu said \"At the beginning of a disease one must also use Xin San to develop lung qi. It is not advisable to simply use cold and cool causing phlegm to block the lungs and cause sudden suffocation. However cooling and heat permeability are also important. Wu Kun'an said on the day \"It is advisable to regulate the heat of qi and also drink from the spleen and family.\" Zhang Yuqing said \"The cold is both deep and the lung heat cannot be resolved.

It is often caused by the deficiency of kidney-yang element in the person or by the cessation of drinking due to the stagnation of the lower energizer; The external pathogenic factors invade the lung and transform it into heat causing the stomach to drink in the middle of the stomach. The upper part is opposite to the lung and the yin and heat are in sync causing the kidney qi to carry the lower jiao deficiency pathogenic factors to invade the upper part. They are combined with the hot drink in the lung and stagnate in the upper part forming a syndrome of excess and deficiency in the upper part which is a combination of deficiency excess cold and heat. Therefore it is a disease that initially blocks the lung qi causing the lung to lose its ability to clear and descend; Following this drinking heat can turn the fire into internal heat causing yang deficiency and heat to rise and vice to rise and fall; In the end the kidney yang weakens and loses its ability to absorb. The kidney qi carries the yin and yang evil and goes against it often resulting in a mix of yin and yang deficiency and excess. And its treatment principle is to clear the heat in the lungs and stomach drive the drink of the upper jiao to treat the evil of the upper jiao and also to warm and assist the kidney yang absorb the kidney qi and consolidate the deficiency of the lower jiao; The ancients said \"Its origin lies in the kidney and its end lies in the lungs.\" It is necessary to consider both the specimen and the specimen.",

Commonly referred to as food loss severe cases are referred to as persistent food intake or food accumulation. If you overeat raw and cold foods you will feel more yin cold qi. The combination of internal and external evil causes damage to the middle energizer which is called two senses of typhoid fever or Taiyin middle cold; If the spleen fails to function properly and there is no distinction between water and grain it is called food diarrhea. Those who cause disorder in the elevation and elevation of the central focus are referred to as foodborne cholera; Obstruction in the upper energizer results in food accumulation in the chest; Stagnant in the middle energizer indicates grain bloating food bloating or alcohol bloating; Temper cannot run on the limbs but is due to food deficiency. Staying in food stagnation in the middle energizer stagnation of the spleen and stomach qi inability to increase the spleen and stomach qi loss of descending stomach qi inability to expand the upper and middle clear qi loss of ascending clear qi inversion of turbid qi and even disorder of ascending and descending. Food stagnation occurs in the stomach and the stomach qi loses its right to regulate and lower; Stagnant in the spleen the spleen loses its ability to maintain good health.

The syndrome of spleen and stomach food stagnation is always caused by the stagnation of food and the stagnation of the middle energizer causing the qi of the spleen and stomach to not function properly. Therefore the treatment principle should mainly focus on dissipating food and guiding stagnation and to dredge and promote the qi mechanism of the spleen and stomach so as to restore the health and circulation of the spleen and the stomach.

It is caused by food stagnation in the stomach and evil stagnation in the lungs or by external factors such as wind and cold or external factors such as heat and heat causing upper stagnation in the lungs and also accompanied by food stagnation in the stomach. Evil stagnation is a syndrome of lung-stomach food stagnation. Evil stagnation and stagnation of qi resulting in poor body fluid are most likely to produce phlegm. Therefore evil food and phlegm are mutually stagnant and in some cases they can block the qi of clearing yang in the upper and middle regions. Those who initially experience evil stagnation and stagnation of qi are commonly referred to as exogenous food intake; The upper and middle two jiao of the depression are called the food knot chest; Blocking the upper and middle clear qi can be called closed syncope which is called food syncope alcohol syncope or middle syncope and is one of the categories. The new recovery of illness caused by overeating is called food recovery which is caused by stagnation of lung and stomach food. The syndrome of lung stomach food stagnation involves external pathogenic stagnation in the lungs and persistent food stagnation in the stomach. The stomach is composed of yang soil which is most likely to transform heat. Although there are different external sensations of cold and temperature it will accumulate and transform heat over time and both belong to cremation. It is a disease and in mild cases it can suppress the qi of clearing yang in the upper energizer resulting in both external and internal diseases; If it is severe it will stagnate the upper and middle qi mechanisms and the disease will lean towards the inside; Its transformation or stagnation on the upper part or even sudden closure of the body is a severe syndrome of food stagnation. The syndrome of lung and stomach food stagnation is characterized by mutual stagnation of pathogenic factors food and phlegm. Therefore the treatment principle should mainly focus on dispersing food stagnation while also promoting lung and resolving phlegm. Always prioritize unblocking the upper and middle qi mechanisms. Once the internal qi is unblocked it can naturally cause external itching while the external evil is self directed; Clear rise and turbid fall clear up and down; Be cautious not to throw cold early to avoid the accumulation of evil food phlegm and qi which will inevitably lead to changes.",

It is caused by the stagnation of food in the stomach moving down to the intestines and the dross in the intestines colliding with each other resulting in obstruction of the conduction of the large intestine and the inability to lower stomach qi. The so-called stagnation of food in the stomach hinders the flow of qi leading to the loss of the pivot of the middle qi. Therefore the onset of the disease is often urgent and severe and external sensation of food entrapment can also be seen. For those with mild pathological changes only stagnation of the clear qi in the middle energizer leads to loss of its clarity; If it is severe it may cause stagnation in the middle energizer either in the stomach or in the spleen causing the qi in the gastrointestinal tract to not flow down; Dramatists on the other hand suddenly suffocate the middle qi causing the qi of the spleen and stomach to rise and fall in disorder which is a sign of urgency and severity. It is always caused by food stagnation in the stomach and intestines and the loss of qi circulation. Therefore its treatment should always be based on promoting the circulation of gastrointestinal qi and gradually eliminating food stagnation. For those who lean towards the stomach the method of vomiting can be explored and the stagnation can be pronounced from above; If the knot is formed in the intestine it should be treated by removing the accumulated qi to attack the knot.",

        "description": "Gastrointestinal heat accumulation syndrome is a syndrome of gastrointestinal food stagnation generating heat and transforming fire. It is caused by the stagnation of food in the stomach that enters the intestines competing with the dross in the intestines. Over time it generates heat and transforms into fire resulting in the accumulation of heat in the gastrointestinal tract. There is a syndrome of typhoid fever with food intake. Zhong Jing said \"Yang Ming and Shaoyang diseases must have a sharp downward movement and those with smooth and numerous veins have a persistent diet.\" It is the accumulation of heat that decocts the body fluid in the intestines and in some cases it forces the blood meridians to form diarrhea which is called self benefit through food intake or the accumulation of dysentery; Due to the accumulation of heat and the accumulation of internal energy the stagnation and clearing of yang qi can become a syndrome of closed syncope which is also an example of yang syncope. Accumulation of heat stagnates in the gastrointestinal tract and in mild cases it can evaporate and heat up the body fluid; Even if it turns dryness into fire it forms in the middle coke. Causing its symptoms to change it may force the body fluid in the intestines to leak and become diarrhea or damage the intestinal collaterals and become red dysentery. Lei Shaoyi said \"The spleen is not functioning properly the stomach is not dissipating heat carries wet food brews in Zhongzhou and becomes stagnation. If there is excessive accumulation of heat in the gastrointestinal tract and the yang qi is blocked there will be a change of closed syncope which is what Yu Genchu said: \"Those with heat closure heat pulsating body fluids gastrointestinal dryness and those with accumulated heat in the intestines often have this disease. Gastrointestinal heat accumulation syndrome is a syndrome of excessive food intake and the accumulation of intestinal dross to transform into fire. Therefore the principle of its treatment is to mainly promote the accumulation of heat in the lower part of the stomach and intestines so that the accumulation of heat in the stomach and intestines can be removed from the lower part. Zhong Jing said \"If there is a persistent food it will heal in the lower part.\" \"If there is a persistent food it will heal in the current part.\" Yu Genchu also said \"To eliminate the accumulation of heat in the lower part it is necessary to clear the stomach and intestines through the corridor.\" This is the only way to treat gastrointestinal accumulation of heat.",

Ascaris lumbricoides originally inhabits the small intestine but due to the imbalance of cold and heat it causes ascaris lumbricoides in the intestine to not be able to coexist and run up in the stomach entering the bile duct resulting in the syndrome of gallbladder stomach worm. Yu Genchu once said \"The stomach and intestines are burning like boiling and the roundworm movement is disturbed. However the deficiency and cold in the middle energizer can also cause intestinal worms to become restless and flee upwards. In mild cases it may cause pain and vomiting of roundworms which is called worm pain. In modern times it is called biliary roundworms. In severe cases it may cause closed syncope which is called roundworm syncope. Insects can disturb the gallbladder and stomach and in mild cases it can stagnate the biliary tract causing the qi mechanism of the gallbladder to lose its smoothness and hindering the rotation of the pivot; Even if you are depressed in the middle you may lose control of the situation; It is not advisable for the performer to vent the wooden fire in their gallbladder or to rush upwards or close it inside resulting in a critical condition. The intestinal worms that invade the gallbladder and stomach are caused by the imbalance of cold and heat in the intestines and stomach. Therefore the treatment principle should not simply expel the worms but rather adapt to their cold and warm conditions to regulate them. The ancients referred to this as the method of relieving roundworms. After it settles down expel it to eliminate its roots.",

        "description": "The deficiency of lung and kidney qi syndrome is a syndrome of lung deficiency and kidney disease where the upper and lower parts of the lungs and kidneys are affected by the same disease. The lung is the source of water above and the kidney is the main organ of water. The lung qi is long weak and body fluid cannot be applied. The kidney water cannot be supported by the lung's qi which will inevitably lead to insufficient kidney water; However the kidney water is unable to ascend nor can it aid the lung yin. Therefore the deficiency of lung and kidney qi syndrome often results in kidney yin deficiency resulting in both qi and yin diseases. At the beginning of its pathological changes it is characterized by deficiency of lung qi weakness in promoting and descending qi and deficiency of kidney qi with no right to absorb qi; If the lung's circulation is abnormal it is powerless to distribute fluid and transform qi; Furthermore the deficiency of both qi and yin in the lungs and kidneys the deficiency of yin and jin and the onset of heat from the inside can lead to the deficiency of qi and yin and the loss of tuberculosis is difficult to avoid. The mild symptoms can lead to qi deficiency and inability to absorb body fluids; Even if it cannot absorb yin blood it becomes a symptom of slipping; Drama on the other hand is exhausted due to the lack of fixation of yin fluid and yin blood resulting in slipping. The kidney is a house of water and fire the extreme of yin deficiency unable to love yang causing fire without returning to its original state and causing yang to float over and become detached. It is characterized by deficiency of lung and kidney qi with frequent changes in exhaustion in the later stage. The principle of treatment is to urgently replenish lung qi nourish kidney yin warm and nourish kidney yang treat both upper and lower levels simultaneously and take into account both symptoms and symptoms to save its failure.",

        "description": "Spleen and stomach qi deficiency syndrome is the fundamental syndrome of middle qi deficiency commonly referred to as middle qi deficiency or insufficient middle qi syndrome. Often due to overwork; Or due to excessive drinking and overeating or excessive hunger and satiety; Alternatively if one takes the medicine to subdue and attack it can damage the qi of the spleen and stomach resulting in a syndrome of insufficient qi in the middle. The spleen and stomach are the internal and external organs with spleen qi controlling the rise stomach qi controlling the fall and the central nervous system ascending and descending. They rely entirely on the qi of the stomach to regulate body fluids and differentiate water and grain; If the stomach qi is not strong it cannot control the main body's movements. In some cases there may be symptoms of inversion and loss of control. If the temper is not strong it cannot control the main body's movements. If the water and grain are not divided it may even sink. The spleen is also used as wet soil and belongs to Yin as the viscera; The stomach is a dry soil belonging to the yang organs. If the spleen and stomach are dysfunctional then the dampness and dryness are mutually beneficial; If the stomach yang is too high it will dissipate and burn the body fluid leading to the risk of fluid drying up; If the spleen is weak it will increase in strength and weakness and there will be a change of slipping. Therefore although the treatment principle is always based on tonifying the middle qi the focus of tonifying the spleen is mainly on sweetness warmth and qi while the focus of tonifying the stomach is mainly on sweetness coolness and nourishing fluids; The spleen is a visceral organ that can be replenished and replenished through obstruction and elevation; The stomach belongs to the viscera and the viscera are replenished by tonifying which was referred to as the method of \"tonifying\" by ancient people. In the clinical trial it should be judged to be deficient and excessive and adjusted and supplemented upon careful consideration.",

Therefore Zhang Zhongjing once said \"Those who manage the middle energizer should benefit from the lower energizer. It is caused by insufficient central qi inability to lift qi deficiency and depression which can lead to abnormal conduction of the large intestine inability to retract and close intestinal qi and inability to open slide and release qi; Shallow means that the body's qi is not solid while deep means that the yin fluid may also slip and become entangled causing changes in the exhaustion of qi and yin.

Therefore the essence of Shuigu cannot be transformed from red blood to blood through human connections and it is dedicated to the heart. This is due to the deficiency of the spleen and leads to the deficiency of the heart qi. Or excessive thinking causing fatigue to the heart and spleen; Worry and fear as well as consuming the energy of the sad spleen can all lead to the syndrome of deficiency of heart and spleen. The heart governs blood the spleen regulates blood and Qi is the commander of blood. Blood originates from Qi while deficiency of the heart and spleen qi often results in deficiency of both Qi and blood. If Qi and blood are insufficient to nourish Yang Qi there is a deficiency heat that arises internally; Heart and spleen qi deficiency unable to control blood resulting in blood overflow from top to bottom. The ancients referred to it as' blood does not return to the meridians' or 'blood does not return to the spleen'. If the heart qi is insufficient it cannot be handed down to the kidneys and if the heart kidney intersects it depends on the spleen. Therefore in cases of deficiency of the heart and spleen the heart and kidneys often cannot intersect resulting in the inability of water and essence to pass on and overflow. The syndrome of deficiency of heart and spleen is mainly characterized by qi deficiency which is insufficient to generate blood. Therefore blood is often insufficient. The treatment principle is to supplement both qi and blood but the main focus should be on supplementing qi which can generate blood. Insufficient blood is due to the deficiency of qi and supplementing qi can generate blood; Nourishing the heart fluid is also essential. As the heart is in a state of constant fire it must be nurtured with the heart fluid. It is necessary to use the heart fluid to warm and nourish the qi and also to use sweet and nourishing products to protect the heart fluid in order to achieve the full effect of tonifying the spleen and nourishing the heart.",

It is caused by insufficient liver blood to nourish the heart resulting in the loss of nourishment in the heart blood. The disease is often caused by excessive blood loss excessive sweating due to typhoid fever or prolonged illness that consumes blood or excessive menstrual blood in women or excessive blood loss due to new childbirth as well as surgical ulcers and pus resulting in blood loss all of which can become the syndrome of heart liver blood deficiency. The heart generates blood while the liver stores blood. Therefore both the heart and liver are the organs of the main blood so the pathogenesis always lies in blood. Either heart blood deficiency is due to heart blood loss of nourishment or liver blood deficiency is due to liver blood loss of nourishment. Moreover both the heart and liver are responsible for nourishing the blood and the deficiency of heart and liver blood is not enough to replenish the blood. This is the result of the deficiency of blood leading to the loss of nourishment in the blood. To its transformation syndrome or due to insufficient qi and blood the movement is weak resulting in qi and blood stagnation resulting in the imbalance of qi and blood deficiency and excess or due to excessive blood loss yang has no basis yang qi floats and there is a change of syncope and detachment. The treatment of heart and liver blood deficiency should be based on nourishing the blood of the heart and liver; The book \"Zhi Zhi\" states: \"Blood is the combination of Qi the beauty of Qi and the glory of blood.\" Blood deficiency means that Qi loses its glory and Qi is also deficient. Therefore supplementing blood should still be combined with supplementing Qi. Supplementing Qi can also generate blood replenish blood and Qi and complement each other.",

The liver and kidney are the organs of the mother and child which nourish each other. \"Yi Gui is homologous \" they coexist and prosper together. Therefore liver blood is insufficient to nourish the kidney meridians resulting in kidney meridian deficiency. Or due to the weakness of liver blood it cannot be filled with kidney yin resulting in insufficient kidney yin essence; Or if the atrium and ventricle are disjointed the kidney essence is depleted and it cannot be fed to the liver it can also lead to insufficient liver blood which is called \"homology of essence and blood\". The Eight Meridians are beautiful in the liver and kidneys and the liver is a sea of blood. Women are born with yin blood in the liver and kidneys which is often related to gynecological menstruation. Liver and kidney blood deficiency syndrome where the lesion is shallow is characterized by insufficient liver blood and loss of blood to nourish the liver; In severe cases kidney yin is also deficient resulting in both yin and blood deficiency; The liver is also the main source of nourishment and the lower jiao is produced by the Wei. Insufficient yin and blood in the liver and kidney can also damage the nourishment and Wei; Internally it damages yin blood and yin blood deficiency cannot match yang which often leads to the floating of liver and kidney yang qi and even the occurrence of syncope and detachment. The treatment principle should be based on nourishing the liver and kidney yin blood; Nourishing the blood of the liver and nourishing the yin of the kidney; Liver blood and feet can be replenished to nourish the kidneys while kidney essence and feet can also be replenished to nourish the liver.

The common saying is that if a cold does not wake up it will become tuberculosis and in mild cases it will damage the lungs fluids and stomach fluids; Heavy coughing can damage the yin fluid as Zhang Yuqing once said: \"Long coughing can damage the lungs and there is a deviation between the yin and yang qi. Qi is fire and fluid is phlegm. Therefore if it lasts for a long time it will inevitably dry up and if yin does not contain yang it will become empty and yang will become hyperactive within ultimately leading to the loss of one's path. The treatment should nourish the fluid of the lungs and stomach benefit the qi of the lungs and stomach and the medicine should be sweet and cool to generate fluid and increase fluid; Do not throw warm dry and spicy powders indiscriminately nor do you act recklessly to relieve pain and cool down.

If the water is deficient the fire will flourish and if the fire is strong it will lead to the rise of punishment and burn the gas and liquid in the lungs. The so-called \"son stealing mother qi\" transformation can all lead to the syndrome of deficiency of lung and kidney yin. The lungs and kidneys are originally the organs of the mother and child and gold and water should be mutually generated. However due to insufficient kidney yin and excessive kidney fire it will inevitably invade the lung's gold. Shallow the clear gold will lose its clarity while deep the lung and kidney qi and yin will be damaged both of which are the roots of fatigue. Lei Shaoyi once said \"Fu dryness burns the lungs lung fluid is exhausted and the source above water is not distributed. The kidneys are also dry and lung and kidney yin are deficient. Deficiency dryness arises internally which is most likely to lead to fatigue and timidity. The kidney is the organ of water and fire and the house of yin and yang. True yin is not enough to love yang. Kidney yang has no basis and it will float above. Fire does not return to its original state and there is a fire without roots. If it suddenly soars there is a risk of yuan yin causing stagnation and solitary yang rising and falling off. Therefore the deficiency of lung and kidney yin syndrome can be delayed and untreated. If delayed it can lead to fatigue and injury while if urgent there is a risk of syncope and detachment. He Lianchen said on the day \"If you fail to turn back your life will follow suit.\" This is what Shao Xiangen said: \"Yin has already exhausted and Yin and Yang will definitely depart. The deficiency of lung and kidney yin syndrome refers to the deficiency of qi and yin in the lungs and the loss of true yin in the kidneys. Therefore the principle of treatment should always focus on nourishing the lungs and kidneys especially nourishing the kidney yin. As the ancients said \"Treating the lungs is not beneficial but the method should be nourishing the kidneys. Lei Shaoyi said \"It is necessary to greatly replenish kidney water to calm its fire and protect its gold. If gold is clear then water is active and water is active then gold can be protected. Gold and water complement each other and there is no danger of starting a prairie fire.\" This method of replenishing water and generating gold. However Yin Qi is depleted and Yang Qi rises alone. Yin cannot be maintained and Yang cannot be hidden. Therefore nourishing Yin and absorbing Yang belong to the Great Dharma. When Jun replenishes kidney yin calms down floating yang and consolidates kidney qi as He Lianchen said: \"To fill essence with a strong agent one must also calm down yang. Ye Tianshi also said \"The root of the Yuan Sea is small not hidden or absorbed. It is important to capture and solidify the truth in order to cure the root cause. He Lianchen further said \"The Zhenyuan style emblem is a medicine that can nourish yin and subdue yang when the Dragon Thunder Rebellion is about to break away. It is urgently necessary to consolidate the original qi gather yin and tonify fluids absorb true yin and suppress latent deficiency yang. Once the phlegm and saliva are opened the mind wakes up and qi continues. It is a medicine that can nourish yin and subdue yang strengthen the element and absorb qi and urgently continue to advance without interruption.",

The disease is caused by the disability of gastric juice gradually leading to the dryness of spleen yin. It is often caused by external factors that cause internal heat and consume body fluids. Or attack by overtaking; Or excessive consumption of spicy fragrant and hot foods can lead to gastric juice being robbed gradually leading to spleen yin depletion and dryness in the middle soil; Or they may indulge in eating spicy and spicy foods with a thick taste fragrant and hot substances accumulate heat and damage the stomach causing hyperactivity and dryness of the stomach soil burning the spleen yin and also causing spleen and stomach yin deficiency. Or due to insufficient stomach yin Yangming body fluid cannot be infused into the spleen resulting in spleen yin deficiency. Fei Boxiong once said \"The fire of Yang Ming is fixed in the spleen causing heat stagnation in the middle of the uterus and depletion of spleen Yin. Due to changes in the stomach and spleen. Or first due to the deficiency of spleen yin the dry soil that moistens yang ming can cause excessive stomach yang as Yao Guomei once said: \"Deficiency of spleen yin leads to dryness of stomach soil\" which is caused by the transformation of the spleen and stomach. If the spleen and stomach are yin deficient and the middle soil is dry the body fluid cannot be transmitted to the lungs. If there is no fluid in the lungs it cannot be distributed to irrigate the hundred meridians. As Xie Yinglu once said \"Dry qi burns gold and the lungs are hot and the leaves are scorched \" resulting in a deficiency of qi and yin. The treatment should always focus on nourishing the spleen and stomach qi and yin. Generate fluid and increase fluid to nourish dryness; Take sweet and refreshing medicine to moisten and moisturize it; It is prohibited to dry heat and damage yin and to avoid the transformation of bitter cold into dryness as well as the stagnation and tonifying of greasy substances that hinder their movement and transformation.",

Often caused by spleen deficiency leading to lung deficiency the deficiency of spleen qi leads to the subtle infusion of water and grain essence into the lungs resulting in a lack of water and fluid to nourish the lungs preventing the weather from descending and the earth's qi from rising. Lung dryness leads to the inability to distribute fluid to the spleen and spleen dryness also has no upper supply to the lungs resulting in the deficiency of both qi and yin in the lungs and spleen. It is commonly seen after severe illness and fever or excessive use of catharsis and attack which can damage one's temper; Alternatively excessive use of warming and dryness as well as the elimination of burning spleen yin can lead to this syndrome. Both the lungs and spleen are dominated by qi so the lung and spleen yin deficiency syndrome is characterized by deficiency of both qi and yin as its basic pathological changes. Yin deficiency often generates internal heat with symptoms of deficiency and steaming; Qi deficiency leads to a lack of energy in movement and there is also a syndrome of stagnation of qi. The principle of treatment should always be to replenish qi and yin to nourish the lungs and spleen. Medicines should be moistened and avoid warming and dryness.

        "description": "Liver and spleen yin deficiency syndrome is a syndrome of weak liver and spleen yin fluid. Due to its frequent occurrence and prolonged illness especially after prolonged diarrhea and dysentery it is most likely to consume the qi and yin of the spleen resulting in the inability of the spleen to transfer essence to fill the liver and the deficiency of yin and blood in the liver; Or heat stroke if left untreated and mistakenly treated can also deplete the liver and spleen yin. If the qi and yin of the spleen are insufficient they cannot transport and transform the essence to moisten the liver; If the yin and blood of the liver are insufficient the liver qi will lose its softness and become rigid dry and rebellious; Yin deficiency leads to internal heat which is caused by deficiency heat and can lead to deficiency steaming; Liver dryness results in qi being horizontal in the middle which is a sign of qi stagnation that is there is a syndrome of deficiency stagnation. If qi and yin cannot be transported and transformed the body fluid stops accumulating; If you lose your grip you can't help but slip and release. The liver and spleen are the foundation of nourishing yin. If the qi and yin of the liver and spleen are insufficient the nourishing yin biochemistry becomes passive and is most likely to turn into a path of damage. Therefore the principle of its treatment is to mainly nourish the liver and spleen yin fluid and also to replenish qi and generate blood in order to nourish its source. However Wu Jutong once said \"Do not use excessive warming and astringency to help yang but yin nor simply use nourishment to prevent the harm of releasing yin.",

        "description": "The syndrome of liver and kidney yin deficiency is a deficiency of liver and kidney essence and blood which is the fundamental disease of lower jiao yin deficiency and a deep and severe syndrome of yin deficiency. The liver stores blood and the kidney stores essence. After suffering from a serious illness for a long time it may arise from excessive exertion and desire or from indulging in alcohol and lust to consume essence and blood leading to lower energizer yin deficiency. The kidney is the organ of water and fire the house of true yin and true yang. Shen Youpeng said \"In the Classic the disease occurs in the kidneys where the kidneys store essence which is the true yin. The true yang also contains the essence. Yang likes to rise and float and is absorbed through yin. If the essence is captured internally then the yang qi has no basis and rises and floats above. Therefore there are multiple syndromes of kidney and yang floating. As the ancients said \" The essence and blood are of the same origin and both belong to the yin of the lower jiao. Yin and blood are not enough to nourish the liver so the liver yang is easy to move; If the yin essence is not enough to fill the kidneys then there is less dragon thunder hidden. Ye Tianshi said \"The yin of the liver and kidney is exhausted and the wind and yang are shining inside.\" Shen Youpeng also said \"If the essence and blood are sufficient then the liver and yang are attached. There is a saying in the Four Ming Dynasty: \"The Yuan Sea has no root and the deficiency is due to the liver and kidney.\" The liver and kidney have a loss of essence and blood and the Yang Qi cannot return to the root. He Lianchen said \"If the fire does not return to the root it is the fire of dragons and thunder. However water and fire coexist in a house where both yin and yang coexist. The single yin does not grow and the solitary yang does not grow. The extreme damage to yin will inevitably affect the true yang; There will eventually be a transformation of yin and yang deficiency with insufficient water and fire; Slow walking can cause fatigue while urgent walking can cause fainting and detachment. Therefore Yu Tinghong said \"The Yin fluid has run out and the Yang qi is about to escape.\" Xie Yinglu said \"The disease is the intersection of Yin and Yang and those who intersect will also die.\" If this intersection of Yin and Yang is completed it will inevitably lead to premature death. The liver kidney yin deficiency syndrome is a syndrome of deficiency of blood yin and essence in the lower jiao yin. The fundamental reason for the disease and congenital deficiency lies in the deficiency of the yuan yin and yuan yang. Therefore the treatment principle is to replenish the essence and nourish the blood in order to nourish the yuan yin of the liver and kidney; However the essence and blood are insufficient and the Yuan Sea has no roots. Therefore it is necessary to use both flesh and blood to nourish and nourish the essence and blood. Yin deficiency leads to yang floating so it should also be used to suppress hidden and floating yang. Therefore Ye Tianshi said \"The medicine is taken with calmness and weight and filled with yin to suppress yang; That is what He Lianchen said: \"Take in the hidden town take in the qi and return to the original place. If water is depleted fire will flourish which is a rootless yin fire. As He Lianchen said \"If fire does not return to its roots it is the fire of dragons and thunder.\" This fire cannot be directly discharged. Wu Kun'an said \"When kidney water is strengthened yin fire is nourished.\" This is the method used by Wang Taifu to \"strengthen the master of water to control sunlight",

        "description": "The deficiency of lung and spleen yang syndrome is the fundamental disease of upper jiao yang deficiency. Multiple spleen yang systems are insufficient to warm the lungs resulting in deficiency of lung yang. Either due to excessive cooling during the disease or post disease imbalance or excessive labor or the feeling of cold pathogenic factors due to labor or improper diet damage to the spleen yang cannot be transmitted to the lungs resulting in clear cold in the lungs and lack of distribution of lung yang resulting in the syndrome of deficiency of lung and spleen yang. The lung governs the health and the health qi originates from the middle energizer. Therefore people with weak lung and spleen yang qi cannot externally replenish the health yang resulting in the weakness of the health yang and becoming a syndrome of superficial yang deficiency. If Wei Yang is unable to solidify body fluids it will cause excessive sweating and discharge commonly known as superficial deficiency spontaneous sweating. Night sweating due to superficial deficiency is also an example of spontaneous sweating due to yang deficiency. The yang of the lung and spleen is the foundation of clearing yang in the upper energizer. If the yang of the lung and spleen is deficient it is unable to lift up so there is often no increase in clearing yang. In some cases the sinking of clearing yang occurs also known as the sinking of the middle yang. If Yang deficiency is weak in absorption there may be changes in the discharge of body fluids and the overflow of blood vessels. The deficiency of lung and spleen yang syndrome is often caused by the deficiency of spleen yang first. Therefore its treatment principle should always focus on warming and tonifying the lung and spleen yang qi especially when tonifying the spleen to help the lung and cultivating soil to generate gold. Deficiency of lung and spleen yang leads to weakness in ascending qi resulting in a lack of ascending qi for clearing yang. Therefore in the process of warming and tonifying Dangshen is used for ascending qi. Qi Youtang said \"When warming the upper part to elevate yang the disease will heal itself.",

        "description": "The syndrome of deficiency of lung and kidney yang is characterized by deficiency of lung yang and kidney yang with upper deficiency penetrating into lower jiao. It is often caused by excessive sweating during the disease which first damages the lung yang. Yang qi leaks out with sweat and in some cases kidney yang also leaks out with sweat; Or due to excessive exposure to cold and cold it may consume the upper Jiao Yang Qi and subsequently damage the kidney Yang; Alternatively a person may have weak kidney yang which is not sufficient to warm the lungs and cause the lungs to be clear and cold resulting in a lack of distribution of lung yang. The so-called water cooling leads to golden cold which further disperses cold and seriously damages yang qi leading to deficiency of lung and kidney yang. Kidney yang is the true yang of the gate of life and the fundamental yang of all yang. The deficiency syndrome of lung and kidney yang is the deficiency syndrome of upper deficiency and lower to deep deficiency. The lung dominates the health and the health comes out of the lower energizer. Therefore in cases of deficiency of lung and kidney yang the external protection of the health cannot be strengthened resulting in the loss of yang due to sweating. Unable to warm the lung inside causing loss of medication resulting in watery and turbid phlegm. If there is a mistake during the illness or if there is a disorder after the illness it will cause deficiency and lack of root of yang and float above it resulting in the collapse of yang qi; Slow down leads to the deficiency of yang qi gradually reaching yin resulting in the syndrome of both yin and yang losses. The treatment principle should always be to warm and nourish the lung and kidney yang qi. Especially when it comes to warming and tonifying the lower elements it can activate the true fire of the kidney obtain the upper steam and warm the lungs then the lung yang can be restored and the cold can be relieved. The ancients referred to it as \"candlelight shining on the sky\" warming it below to save it above.",

It is often caused by the deficiency of spleen yang and the inability to warm stomach yang resulting in insufficient stomach yang and weak visceral yang qi deficiency. Often caused by prolonged illness and post illness disorders; Or excessive use of bitter cold to attack the spleen and stomach during illness; Or overeating raw and cold foods fruits and melons or frozen foods can damage the spleen and stomach yang qi; Or if the diarrhea benefits for a long time and the middle yang gradually declines it can lead to the syndrome of insufficient yang qi in the spleen and stomach. If the stomach yang deficiency leads to the inability to ripen the water and grain while the spleen yang deficiency leads to the inability to transport and transform the water and grain. In some cases the spleen yang lacks the power to ascend leading to the passage of the water and grain through the large intestine without being able to absorb it. If the water and grain are more clear and effective it can seriously damage the middle yang causing cold to start from the middle and can also force the middle yang to float over leading to the transformation of fainting and detachment. Its treatment should focus on warming the middle and returning to yang with the main focus on consolidating the middle and jiao yang qi.",

Yu Genchu said \"Due to excessive use of cold and cooling herbs it can cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract.\" Wu Kun'an said \"If you attack too much it can cause damage to the lower part of the stomach and the intestines and stomach are connected causing direct discharge and leakage. If the benefits are not closed the Yangming Gate has already been removed.\" However it is related to the spleen yang so Yu Genchu also said \"The spleen yang falls off.\" In addition the kidney serves as the door for the stomach.

Due to the deficiency of kidney yang element the fire of the vital gate cannot warm and steam the middle energizer resulting in insufficient spleen yang and powerless circulation resulting in internal injury of spleen and kidney yang deficiency syndrome. The ancients said \"It is often seen in the generation of wine and lust.\" He Lianchen said \"Wine dampness harms the spleen lust harms the kidneys. During the course of the illness excessive use of cold and cold energy can deplete the yang qi of the spleen and kidney. He Lianchen said \"A large dose of medicine is used to treat the spleen and kidney constantly advancing and striving for quick recovery. The first dose is less effective and the spleen and kidney yang will be damaged for a long time. However the use of attack and elimination will further damage the kidney yang and seriously damage the qi. The disease cannot be cured at this point. Long term illness can also lead to spleen and kidney yang deficiency. The Inner Canon states: 'Ying Chu Zhong Jiao' Wei Chuxia Jiao Therefore the deficiency of yang in the spleen and kidney which cannot be replenished with the external yang leads to yang deficiency on the surface and even damages the yin and wei. The kidney is the innate origin and the spleen is the acquired origin. The deficiency of yang in the two origins cannot stir up and clear yang causing it to fail to lift and sink instead. The deficiency of yang in the spleen has no power to transport and transform qi while the deficiency of yang in the kidney cannot transform qi and water. Over time it becomes water and accumulates causing swelling and swelling which is still an example of yin and water. If the qi cannot be vaporized it becomes cold drenching and deficiency drenching. The deficiency of yang cannot be absorbed but it becomes cave discharge feast discharge and kidney discharge; Kidney deficiency leads to inability to absorb qi spleen deficiency leads to loss of solid absorption and in extreme cases there is no root in the Yuan sea fire does not return to the Yuan state and deficiency yang floats above the upper level resulting in a change of wearing yang and stagnating yang; If the deficiency persists for a long time it will gradually lead to damage to one's path. The kidneys are the organs of water and fire. Yin and Yang coexist in the same house and the damage to Yang will not recover. It will gradually reach Yin becoming a syndrome of both Yin and Yang losses. The spleen and kidney yang deficiency syndrome has been damaged for two consecutive days and the foundation of the deficiency syndrome has been shaken. He Lianchen said \"The disease is at this point and it cannot be done\" \"Warm and replenish the spleen and kidney to save residual yang\". Therefore the treatment principle should always focus on warming and strengthening the yang qi of the spleen and kidney especially on nourishing the fire of the vital gate and strengthening the yang in the spleen. However the ancients have said that \"tonifying the spleen is not as good as tonifying the kidney\" or \"tonifying the kidney is not as good as tonifying the spleen\". After studying their theories both cannot be ignored. Warm and strengthen the kidney yang help the life fire to warm the spleen and soil. \"If there is no salary at the bottom of the Busi it is necessary to increase the salary at the bottom of the Busi\" to help the spleen yang decompose and transform the water and grain which is the correct method of replenishing fire and generating soil. By warming and tonifying the spleen yang and vibrating the granary the essence of water and grain can be replenished to fill the innate body. The \"Inner Canon\" claims that \"those who obtain grain will prosper\" and the ancients said that \"if the stomach yang is restored then all yang can be restored\". Therefore tonifying the spleen and kidney should be determined based on the severity of the condition and cannot be generalized.",

        "description": "Liver and kidney yang deficiency syndrome is a syndrome of kidney yang deficiency and liver yang deficiency. It is the fundamental disease of deficiency of lower Jiao Yang. Diseases often arise from indulgence that consumes kidney yang; Or for those who have been suffering from ejaculation for a long time the yang qi leaks out with the essence; Years of aging fire decline and exhaustion of essence can lead to the loss of kidney yang the decline of life fire and the inability to nourish the liver. As a result liver yang also declines resulting in the syndrome of liver and kidney yang deficiency. Or due to prolonged exposure to gonorrhea women may experience vaginal discharge and excessive exposure to cold cold and excessive penetration; Or fetal birth imbalance damage to liver and kidney yang qi can also lead to liver and kidney yang deficiency syndrome. The deficiency of liver and kidney yang syndrome originates from the kidney and its pathological changes are often characterized by insufficient kidney yang; If the kidney yang is insufficient the qi will not reach the state capital resulting in insufficient water and fluid; If yang deficiency cannot be absorbed it will cause the body fluid and yin essence to slide and leak; If yang deficiency cannot be absorbed then the kidney qi is reversed; Life and fire decline the Yuan Sea has no roots the true Yang is lost and the fire does not return to the Yuan resulting in the floating of the empty Yang. In some cases the lower and upper realms become empty and there is a change of syncope and detachment. Kidney yang deficiency leads to the decline of life gate fire while liver yang deficiency leads to a lack of vitality; Kidney stores essence liver stores blood and liver kidney yang deficiency cannot transform into essence and blood; The daily consumption of essence and blood blood deficiency cannot fill the camp and yang deficiency cannot vibrate the guard resulting in the loss of camp and guard stagnation of external evil loss of nourishment in the meridians and a change in impotence. The kidney is the foundation of innate nature while the liver is the foundation of a woman's innate nature. It governs the essence and blood while the deficiency of liver and kidney yang leads to passive biochemistry. Therefore the daily consumption of essence and blood is bound to lead to the loss of human life especially in the case of the kidney which is a residence of water and fire. The true yin and true yang cannot be restored and the damage to yang will gradually reach the yin causing both the true yin and the true yang to be damaged. At this point the disease's root is shaken and it is difficult to quickly rise. Therefore the principle of its treatment is always to warm and replenish the yang of the liver and kidney and once the essence and blood have been depleted it is necessary to fill in the essence and blood. This yang generates yin and grows in order to strengthen its underlying elements and strengthen its foundation which is what the ancients called the method of \"filling the underlying elements\". However one should not simply use hardness and dryness as it may consume more essence and blood. They should be selected as the kind-hearted ones to nourish and nourish and then ignite a fire to return to health guiding the sea of dragons and people and hoping for the treatment of yin and yang secrets.",
